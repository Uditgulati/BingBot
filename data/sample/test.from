Hillary Clinton's behavior for the past few days...
What is Hillary Clinton
QUIT FOCUSING ON EARLY REPORTS IN OHIO AND PA. IT'S ONLY THE COUNTIES THAT ARE REPORTING. IF WE OUTPERFORMED FLORIDA +4 THERE IS NO WAY WE'RE LOSING OHIO. WE PROBABLY WIN PA.
Don't laugh, here's how Bernie can still win. Hahahahaha. Michigan and Pennsylvania are both going RED!

Guys, I think I figured out who was really President for the past 8 years.
The chicken told me so.
"Favorite Highlight during a debate with my Anti-Trump family I'm the only centipede I know here in the California Bay Area. Typical family debates about politics are usually everyone against me. Today was especially picante. Family Members: ""It's hypocritical what Trump said about illegal immigrants. His wife was illegal when she was doing porn in New York."" Me: ""Where's the proof?"" Family: ""What?"" Me: ""Where's the proof that she was illegal in New York? Show me."" Family: ""Well... Trump says lots of stuff without proof."" Me: ""So you have no proof?"" Family: ""Who cares? Trump is going to start WWIII."" Me: ""Actually, Hillary has more of a reputation of being a war hawk and uses way more warlike language than Trump does. Trump wants peace more than anything. If anyone would start WWIII, it'd be Clinton with how much she is blaming Russia for everything. Plus, Hillary Clinton broke the law multiple times and was directly responsible for the death of Americans."" Family: ""Trump's broken laws, too."" Me: ""What laws?"" Family: ""His tax returns. You really think he got all that money legally?"" Me: ""He's run hundreds of hugely successful businesses and doesn't have a pattern of having people close by him die suddenly."" Family: ""You know Trump's killed people."" Me: ""Where's the proof?"" Family: ""Come on, you know he did."" These are my struggles. This is the ecosystem of a centipede in California...."
"What should I do about my current class situation where I am being attacking by literally everyone for supporting Donald Trump. My new semester just started a few weeks ago and the first day of class it was beyond obvious that my professor was a die hard Clinton supporter. On top of that he uses every example possible during his lectures to make Clinton look like the savior of the U.S while turning Trump in to the devil. Not to mention all the students are sheep. Today though specifically I felt like I was being singled out for my support of Donald Trump, which was only made obvious because my professor said something about how Donald Trump is a bad man and I replied with ""How is Trump considered bad compared to clinton."" That is when the entire class laughed and I could here mumbling of ""ohhh here we go."" So at this point I feel like I am being singled out and harassed by not only the professor for looking at me every time he gives some stupid clinton/trump example where she always comes off as the lord and savior of our country but also by the students themselves. I say the students to because I was pretty much baited/verbally attacked by a muslim student who was making some kind of example and in it the student said that ""Donald Trump wants to ban all Muslims from coming in to the U.S and all the ones currently here which includes me."" This is when the professor looked over at me as if I was the terrible being for supporting such a hateful person. This is also when I stuck up for my self and Trump and proceeded to speak on trumps immigration policy and vetting process for future Muslims wanting to come to America that are coming from conflict areas or suspected areas. Honestly I may be over thinking all of this but it does feel like I am almost being targeted in this class for who I support and my only reason for ever and telling them who I support was because the professor is saying that trump is a bad man. edit1:probably a lot of grammar mistakes I am typing this 3 minutes before my next class. I will fix them later."

Let me tell you what I really think of this fucking sub. By the way, let me start by saying I've had a few drinks already. Yeah, it's 4:00 in the afternoon. Whatever. It's Friday so get over it. This sub happens to be one of the best things in my life right now. I'm not looking for some sympathy bullshit but I just got out of a 10 year relationship. She is taking all my precious animals too. That is a mutual decision though. I come on this sub and all I feel is positivity. I don't even go to the reddit home page anymore. I come here. I have been coming here for a long time. Everyone is so nice to one another. All we want is a beautiful, well run country. God, I love Donald Trump so fucking much. He's going to save us and most people don't even fucking appreciate it. I literally weep when I watch any Trump videos. Tears of joy. This sub is basically what my life is when I'm not working has become. I love all you motherfuckers, and we are going to win this. There is no alternative. You god damn motherfuckers, you've gotten to my heart, which isn't easy to do. We are going to save this god damn country. And we are going to make America great again. Motherfuckin Donald Trump!!!

Holy crap, I helped set up for my company's warehouse sale today. I never want to look at another pair of shoes again! I didn't even see any I really like :/
This weekend was so freaking productive. Six flags, outlet mall where I actually spent more money on my SO than myself! And binged (it is spelled out so weird!) all of Stranger Things. I WASHED ALL OF MY BRAS GUYS. I'm sad to admit it has been like a year or 2 that I've done that... Anyways, I'm still in a spendy mood for fall clothes and I'm trying to figure out if I should get knee high boots or otk boots. Black, flat, leather and possibly the stretchy back. I'm not sure which height I want more, previous years I've wanted the otk but unsure if it is wise to invest in now?
Yiiiisssss
It's not under warranty anyway unfortunately. It's a 6-year-old used car and we made a deal when we bought it for a year of powertrain coverage but that expired last month (so hopefully not a powertrain issue!).

I had another where I was in a purple dress with a broken strap? and day of forgot to do my makeup and people were starting to show up -.- One.More.Week lol.
The Omega Men by Tom King... how good is it?? The Barnes and Noble sale includes The Omega Men by Tom King. I've heard some about this title and that it's getting a lot more recognition now that Tom King is writing Batman. But how good is it? I'd normally borrow from the library first, but my local library system doesn't have one. What are your thoughts? Thanks!

Lots of younger guys coming in for Atlanta. I like it.
We (OCSC) signed a ton of promising youngsters prior to entering MLS and we saw how that worked out....I love the approach but we can all temper those expectations
RIP Allocation Ranking Order. Now we just have to sign some defenders.
Martinos time in both Barca and Argentina were anything but great. There is a reason he is in Atlanta now. Obviously this transfer is huge for mls, but i still dont understand the reasoning from Almirons side. This guy could easily go to a club in a top european league.
How were Montreal handled differently from other MLS2 teams?
Hot take: I still think Atlanta will struggle to make the playoffs
Yeah....yep. Ugh my only hope is that this starts a pissing contest between Kraft and Blank, only instead of pissing they're throwing money at EPL prospects that aren't Euro based. I can hope, right?
Here's to hoping all can land on their feet somewhere.
This has to be the end surely? So the intellectual property will survive it looks like but the second incarnation is done as far as a competitive franchise.
This would give them 8 international players, which is the maximum without trading for other spots. All are attacking players, except one. I expect them to buy 2 or 3 in order to have some international's on defense. But it's easy to buy or get some domestic defenders from the draft or expansion draft; so they aren't to worried.
Burrito Martinez asks to be released from RSL, citing personal reasons
They didn't see themselves as equals. NASL saw themselves as equals with MLS (they weren't), and USL saw themselves as equals with NASL (they weren't).
"Orlando City on Rowdies bid: ""We have the MLS rights throughout central and north Florida, so any discussion of another franchise would have to include us"""
This is risky...we talk about the USL's TV prospects on the new World Soccer Talk Pod (which Nipun hosted until a few weeks ago...episode should be out Thu night) and I think the YouTube push has been good and I advocated sticking with that for another few years before going full blown onto TV. But I guess they aren't waiting.
Who do you think will eventually be rivals? DC United? Atlanta Silverbacks? Who do you think?
"that's their twitter account handle, that's how they were initially introduced. If I had indicated a ""new Chicago pro team"" people may not realize that it's the same project that Wilt associated himself with causing confusion."
I'm fairly sure Peterson has been run out of town by now.
But there used to be a team in the mls, is that stadium not fit to the requirements of the league?
YES!!! We have our defensive leader now.
FIFA and UEFA will find a way to sneak in another UEFA slot.
I think what they're saying is that rejecting the call up as a conscientious objector would send a stronger message than taking a knee
They can't though. All stadiums that host D2 games need to be 5000 seats. All of them. No exceptions. What you are proposing will happen runs completely counter to what USSF has done since the requirements were put into place. It's a fantasy.
Oh, Tell me who owns the Strikers trademark then, mad NASL fanboy lol.

Stop complaining about supply drops, like seriously
The fact that it's dated is what makes it bad imo. To compete with modern FPS and modern CoDs it needed changing. Too many things in CoD 4 wouldn't make it into newer CoDs becuase of how stupid they are. It needs balancing now. In 07 it was fine. Now it's not. And yes I have played WAW, BO1 and MW2. I love WAW. I hate MW2. BO1 is my favourite CoD.

~~1,345,411~~ He seemed to have been pretty inactive after 200k unfortunately. I remember he and you helped me get my first get. I remember he was #1 in hof when I joined and he was always really fast. He was actually the first person to get a 2 1s replies in a row IIRC. Without him I probably wouldn't have ever been able to run threads

"I do this when someone is keeping a secret from me. I'll be all ""yeah that's cool, I understand... what, are you cheating on your husband or something?"" And then all of a sudden you get the entire story."
The pronunciation was confirmed in the movie a long time ago haha I don't like the way they pronounce it though. I don't like the official pronunciation of Rayquaza either
His ulti gives bonus armor and mr rather than ad
Why do Trump fans eat up every bullshit conspiracy theory that Trump spews but the second they hear something negative about Russia they throw a fit and cry foul?
Hard to find Jill Stein supporters here
He talks a lot about 'riggers' but it's a code word.
U.S. stock futures surge after Clinton cleared by FBI
Bruce Springsteen Will Join POTUS, FLOTUS and Hillary Clinton in Monday's Final Rally
Sabato always seems pretty fair in his projections. I think I've only ever seen him on Fox News, though.
Incoming blowout
Dont be mad bruh.
What's that?
"No, it's just phrasing taken out of context. Clinton wanted Tony Blair to accompany her to Israel for peace negotiations. Tony Blair had a meeting already scheduled with the Rothchilds in Colorado. Hillary ""asked"" if Tony Blair could instead skip the meeting with them and join her in Israel. He did. She thanked them."
Trump National Policy Adviser: Voters Don't Care About Policy Specifics
Ronald would have at this rate.
I bet they're convinced that this will cause Clinton to drop out by the end of the debate.

So she's still against gay marriage and has different public and private positions. Sounds... reasonable?

Trying to avoid nuclear war with Russia is nuts?
At least NBC is American owned! Keep job's in America!
... You think everyone looks at a 10 year old girl and does the 'When can I legally bang her' math?
I would say he hates Trumpism rather than the man himself. Hatred of others is considered an uncharitable act in Catholicism and essentially a blockade to salvation.
Yeah, I get that argument. At this point, I'd prefer is she lived in NC as well.
Unless it's a foreign intelligence service, they're using it for leverage, and this is a threat.
Donald Trump Has Turned Republican Voters Against Paul Ryan
He looked utterly defeated. I've never seen him like this.
I don't know, he's more of a new york republican tbh. He just ramped up the social conservative bullshit for this election and threw in some economic illiteracy for the masses.
Time? The magazine? I knew it!
I know external polling shows him losing it.
Ohh the shower of post down votes. I think people are upset that their beloved crooks emails ended up on a pedophiles computer. Just think of all the emails the rapist she's married to has! Hahahaha
Is it really hillarious and ammusing?
And is substantially less boring! But also really, really stupid.
I played The Witcher 3 and I could never accept money from the poor widow that just lost her husband to some monster I had to kill, I just feel bad for NPCs in video games, breaking the codex of my character along the way as well in this case.
Ofcourse. Reminiscent of a flying squirrel at maximum elongation.
"""Oh, OK. Well, consider this well-earned then. \*flips the bird, walks away*"""
Wait, what? Julian was Alchemy? Next thing you'll be telling me Barry Allen is the Flash.
No it's not just on Linux, it's on almost every OS. Vim was built to be a terminal based text editor though, so to really use it the way it was meant I would recommend a *nix system. With the huge range of plugins including semantic error correction and autocompletion with YCM, I can't think of a better all around text editor. Checkout vimawesome.com!

Itachi would be the Hokage. Then Obito would attack the village, and Itachi would seal the Kyuubi into Sasuke and he'd die. Naruto's parents would be dead, and Naruto would seek revenge on the leaf. Naruto and Sasuke would fight and Sasuke would win, because he would have always been his friend. Sasuke would become Hokage, and Naruto would wander the world to redeem himself.

That's great! A lawyer I used to know exited the US market, got his LLM at a big university in the EU, and practices government/administrative law now over there. I'm so glad other countries treat attorneys better! Also, Canada for the win. I think you guys have us beat on almost all quality of life and labor fairness scales. Life goal: reincarnate Canadian.
"Use the 5-3-1 method. List 5 places you're willing to go. Have her pick 3 of those 5. Now you make the final decision. Simply asking ""where do you want to go"" will get an ""I don't know,"" since there are too many options. Just listing out places one at a time will get all of them shot down. Furthermore, she likely doesn't want to make the final decision, so everything turns into a ""no"". By giving her a list and telling her to pick several, she's not stuck making the final decision, she's just picking places she'd be willing to go. Then you make the final decision, and she can't complain because she had a hand in choosing."
It's almost like there are different people here with different opinions.
So we should just not call a foul when someone gets slugged in the face first because it ruins the highlight reel
Too bad about that kings game tho
Really? I didn't pay much attention to the contracts in the off season (sorry), but isn't his contract super high and a lot of people were saying it wasn't worth it?
Why doesn't Thon Maker get minutes? I don't watch Milwaukee too much and was wondering why Thon Maker doesn't get minutes. I know he's only a rookie, but still, he's only gotten 13 minutes all season. Are the Bucks just too deep for him to get minutes? Or did he have some kind of injury or something?
I think it's weird to evaluate a player before he's retired.... The ESPN rating of Steph as a number 4 PG was weird to me as well. Its like judging a story before the ending has been written.
LeBron James: 44th career triple-double (breaks tie with Fat Lever for 6th-most in NBA history).
Because Anthony Davis.
I still wouldnt want him on the team right now. Not that hes a bad player or anything, but he would stunt the growth of our young team
That's true. Nobody turned in LeBron when he lost in 2014.
Like gotten the official Pelicans Twitter account to tweet out Pimp Pelican.
"Embiid fell for the obvious ""almost lose the ball then get it back with no time on the shot clock"" trick."
Forget Russell Westbrook's triple-double thing, we should all be focusing on Nick Young joining the 50-40-90 club.
Raptors outscored 23-16 in the 3rd without Kyle Lowry. He comes back from getting stitches and scores 19 in the 4th. If Lowry played for the Heat or a more national televised team he'd be in top 5 voting for MVP no doubt
It's Lowry, watching them it's obvious, especially if you look at defense and stats paint an even more obvious picture. Demar is overrated and Lowry is underrated, so it's a lot bigger gap than most think.
I wonder what Boogie's username is
Like a good neighbor State Farm is there! Hope everyone is ight tho. #toosoon #yourecovered
If D Wade and Curry were in the same draft, which would you take knowing everything about their careers now? I'd take Wade. He can put a team on his back and will them to a title. Think his peak was longer and better than Curry's will be. Was also a monster wing defender and also goat guard shot blocker
It's a good block?
Terrence Ross tied with Vince Carter in the Raptors 3-point leader board I know everyone's going on and on about how DeRozan became the scoring leader at last night's game but something else happened last night too. Terrence Ross scored 4 3s, making him tied with Vince Carter at 4th place in the Raptors leaderboard. I remembered seeing a post about this on r/nba and went to check back this morning and noticed he's tied. 1. Morris Peterson 801 2. Kyle Lowry 740 3. Andrea Bargnani 579 4. Terrence Ross 554 Vince Carter 554 6. Jose Calderon 456 7. Doug Christie 431 8. Damon Stoudamire 374 9. Anthony Parker 342 10. Patrick Patterson 308

Totally, but clearly it's not working if they are reaching out to PonPon to reach out to the pros personally. I mean, why not do that from the start? They have more of an understanding of the games mechanics than most of the developers do in that sense (maybe... I could be REALLY wrong on that last line haha). I love Smite, I would just like to see HiRez grow up and take matters into their own hands instead of waiting on the public to do some of the work for them.

Odin Rework Now I don't know about you guys, but I hate Odin's kit. Not because it isn't incredibly fun if you snowball. Not because he's an ultbot late game that can't do shit, but because it's not lore friendly. He was a shrewd fellow. He watched the world from the safety of his home using his ravens as his eyes. He never really engaged in battle. He instigated battles. He was more of a ruler-shaman than a frontlining destroyer like Smite makes him out to be. He acted more like a Saruman than a Gandalf. He gave his eye for wisdom, not for getting 2 kills in solo and then one-shot birdbombing a mid laner. Where are his tools of war? Where are his ravens and wolves? So Skadi gets a fake animal, but you can't even use Odin's REAL ones? I'd like to see something cool like his passive on AOM where you got 2 ravens that could fly around the map and explore/get a view of the world. I mean maybe it would be sort of broken, but there's not anything that's cool and unique like that on smite yet. Basically 2 mobile wards(1 if it's too much) that could be easily destroyed by enemies and had some sort of cooldown. I feel like it would be an interesting mechanic. Then how about actually using his wolves in battle instead of them just not existing. You could add them as a line ability for wave clear, have them target people similar to kaldr, lay in wait similar to arachne's spiders or chase people like bastet's cats. I'd rather not copy a mechanic that's already in the game though. My personal idea is to have a targeter on the ground similar to artemis' trap where they come out of the ground and grab the person and pull them towards odin for a short period of time(*copies mechanic already in the game*). Also please make him ranged! We need a unique ranged warrior and I don't recall him using gungnir to beat the fuck out of people in close quarters. Spears are made to be thrown. Basically, I'd love for odin to be what he was. A wise, all-seeing God who should sit in the backline and support/command people, but be down to go in and do work when the time calls for it. Not someone who should be going literally all-in at any given time. I feel like so much could be done with his kit, but it's so boring right now. Here's my kit idea, fix everything that you think is too much or too little. Passive: Raven's Sight Every 180(240?) seconds, Odin spawns a raven(2 maximum). The raven will fly randomly around the map giving vision, but will avoid buff camps, objective areas, and towers/phoenixes. This raven can be destroyed by 2 enemy basics, but provides a 20 protection debuff for 4 seconds when destroyed. Also, if destroyed, the cool down for the next raven is reduced by 60 seconds. Secondary passive: Odin's basic attacks are ranged 1: Den of Wolves Odin sets a trap onto the ground. (Think of the size of mercury's made you look at rank 2). If an enemy god walks over the trap, Odin's wolves will emerge from the snow biting and dragging the enemy towards their master for .4/.6/.8./.8/1s Damage: 85/110/135/150/165(+60% of physical scaling) Cool down: 16s at all ranks(scaling Cool down would break IMO) 2) Wisdom of Mimir Odin receives the wisdom he gave his eye for increasing his physical power and movement/attack speed(his current passive essentially) Movement/attack speed buff: 8%/12%/12%/16%/20% Physical power buff: 10/20/30/40/50 Cool down: 14s 3) Come, Sleipnir(line ability) Odin's mighty steed comes careening out of the sky doing damage and silencing the first enemy God hit for .5 s. (Has a short cast time similar to kuku's ult so you can drop it and land it as you're running away and then pop your 2. This will also be your main clear) Damage: 100/150/200/250/300(+30% of physical scaling) Cooldown: 18/17/16/15/14 Ultimate: The Allfather Odin is imbued with the spirit of his einherjar as he roars and goes into battle. Odin's basic attacks become melee and he gains immunity to basic attack movement penalties. Odin also gains damage mitigation. Odin obtains an additional damage mitigation bonus if the ultimate is used while his ravens are alive. This can stack twice. Canceling his ultimate early will remove the melee attacks and damage mitigation, but the basic attack movement penalty will remain until the ult would have finished. Damage Mitigation: 20% Damge Mitigation Bonus: 15% per Raven Duration:4s/4s/6s/6s/8s Cool, now let me know how dumb/crazy I am and what in the kit should change. Cheers, guys. TL;DR: Make Odin lore friendly. Where are his ravens? Where are his wolves? Where's the wisdom he sacrificed an eye for? Why does one of the most complicated Gods in the game have such a bleh kit?
Nah dude optical is definitely a word, heard a teacher use it once

Not much to do in the actual suburb, but having South Yarra station means it's really easy to get anywhere SE of the Melbourne CBD. Fawkner Park is really nice too - lots of big open areas and a footy oval as well, although that's towards the edge of the suburb. If you're set on finding a place there, I'd probably start on the corner of toorak road and chapel St and go from there - that part of the suburb is probably the best combination of things to do and convenience (walking distance to supermarkets and South Yarra Station)

"How will WWE fans react if WWE is setting all of this up to put Roman Reigns over Brock in a ""Hogan over Andre"" moment? Lesnar evens the score 1-1 with Goldberg, then wins a re-match. He has now beaten everyone he's ever faced with a winning record. They can now truly call him the ""Conqueror"" of all. BUT in a 1 on 1 match he has never beaten Roman. Both times they fought turned into triple threat matches. They meet at Mania for the first time ever in a guaranteed singles match (because no MITB this year), and the winner will prove who is the Best. Reigns takes out the Beast Incarnate and conquers the conqueror. Roman inherits the Streak and officially becomes the Roman Empire. Lesnar has not been pinned since HHH in 2013, that is coming up on 4 years. Roman can spear him at Mania 33 and finally become the undisputed face of the WWE for the next decade."

"My Theory I think William didn't killed the kiddos of SL I think they did a ""suicide"" by getting them selves in springlock suits that's why if you backward the trailer you will hear ""Suicide didn't work, right?"" There is a ""right?"" Because when they already got springlocked in the suit and they are already animatronics it felt like they are still alive like their suiciding didn't really work, it is more like they had a second life. Then now all they only want is to play with you. So, that's all."

You're playing as an employee he hired.

"Theory - CBEAR used to be the underground storage facility for Freddy Fazbear's (SPOILERS) During Dawko's stream, we were talking about the importance of the ""Spring Chica"" suit in SL, and why it came from Baby's ""old pizzeria"" We came to the conclusion that ""Spring Chica"" originated from Chica's Party World, which is either A.The old version of Circus Baby's Pizza World or B.CPW is Spring Chica's room in CBPW, so like how Ballora is in Ballora Gallery, Spring Chica is in Chica's Party World. Going with B, the idea that Chica's Party World is simply a part of Circus Baby's Pizza World, we theorized that Circus Baby's Pizza World was the sister location where the spring incidents mentioned in FNAF 3 happened, and that the incident happened in 1983. We can assume that the spring incident also happened around the same time as the Ice Cream girl getting killed, because... Dawko said that the ""gas leaks"" mentioned in the ""CANCELLED"" teaser was actually a cover up so that they can move the evidence. The evidence that 1.There was a spring incident and 2.The girl died This is why the teaser mentions ""men taking machinery out of the location in tarps"" they're moving the animatronics. Where? Underground Now, this ties into what phone guy says in FNAF 3: ""The classic suits are being retired to the **appropriate location** while being looked at by our technicians."" Where do we see the ""Spring Chica"" suit located? Underground, in a location where **technicains** work The location in SL used to be where FFP stored and checked on their animatronics and machines That's why in SL, on the map, we see that the location is connected to Fredbear's Family Diner, because it was used for the Fredbear and Fazbear resturants. It was an underground storage facility This is very similar to the IRL underground tunnels used for Disney World. It was an underground storage facility that was used for the Fazbear company. Of course, in SL, Freddy Fazbear's is closed down Which is why the underground location is converted into ""Circus Baby's Entertainment and Rentals"" (CBEAR), which is where the SL gameplay takes place."

I know I could just look at a giant list of everything that came out but I would have no idea where to even begin so I thought some voices on here might help. Thanks in advance.

"What Does Anxiety Mean to You? I think in this time the word 'anxiety' has taken on this whole other... identity. I never really understood it. Google, defines anxiety as, ""a feeling of worry, nervousness, or unease, typically about an imminent event or something with an uncertain outcome."" The word 'anxious' also has the same definition. But I never fully understood it when someone in my life has ever told me ""I have anxiety,"" or I if read a comment someone made on reddit about how they can't ask their crush out because of their ""crippling anxiety"". I'm the most confident person I know, but I feel anxious all the time. When I'm wearing a new outfit, when people stare at me, before a job interview. Is my 'anxiousness' different from your anxiety? In my head, if my feelings of insecurity and doubt are stopping me from doing something, I tell myself that I'm being a coward, I ask myself 'What's the worst that can happen?' and I do it. But what is it like having those feelings be so strong that it really does constrict you from doing what you want? Is anxiety just a state of being? I'm curious."

America and much of Europe is facing an unfortunate demographic shift due to being invaded and outbred by a culture where being gay is taboo and everyone breeds. If we want to secure the existence of our people and a future for white children, we have to breed and stay in the majority. Otherwise our culture goes right out the window, and you gay guys go right off the roof after the hostile culture invading us institutes Sharia law.

help So I identify as a bisexual and I've developed a crush on a guy. He toys around with me for example, tries to make me laugh by doing something random. Winking just for laughs, or when our eyes meet he won't look away and I won't either so we just end up laughing. But I have a suspicion that he's just acting how he normally is... I'm getting a vibe from him and this girl. So yeah, thats my story. Any thoughts on if he actually sort of likes me or is it just one-sided?

Smoke Break
Do i suck him or get over him I've had a crush/ been in love with this boy for a year and a half and im gonna be in his class for a year and a half more. I think he's really hot and i honnestly want to suck his dick. At first i thought he was gay but i soon realised he wasn't. So he's always seen me as a friend but things have changed. I told a group of girls in my class i was gay and when they asked who i was attracted to most if our class i said i thought they were mostly ugly but he is ok and one afternoon during a free class one of them told him i was gay but als said that i had said he was my type. so he was really shocked and sorta made a display out of it and avoided me. In the next course i got so upset and walked out of class with some friends who already knew. A few minutes later he also came and appolegised for the display, hugged me and told me he accepted me ubderstands that what she said about him being my type was a lie. He said that the boys in the class were indeed mostly ugly. But now things are different in a way, a certain vibe is gone. We used to have eachother on snapchat and he was always the first to watch my story but i just discovered that he has deleted me. I honestly dont wanna get over him and in fact i just wanna suck his dick but i realise will probably never happen. So i want to get over him but thats hard since he will be in my life for so long. Thank you for reaing, me, gay, 17yo I wanted some more reactions so i posted it again

Perfect Date ... Now What? I went on a date with a great guy yesterday. We walked aimlessly around the old square near me for a few hours after talking over coffee. It was apparent from his and my body language that we were into each other. He low-key peacocked. So, I invited him back to my place. We fucked. Some of the best sex I've ever had. We showered and then took a nap for a couple hours even though he was supposed to leave for home hours ago. He spooned me the entire time and kissed my back when he would half come out of sleep. He said he was interested in a meaningful relationship before and after we met. I think he's a spectacular human. How long do I wait before contacting him? Should I wait until he contacts me first? (He lives in a different state a few hours away but stays near me for work a week at a time every so often.)
Even if you don't like Suoerman you have to read Superman#7 by Tomansi also SPOILERS. It's a fun read and it had me actually laughing. The writing is amazing the art is gourgus and its the best issue in the current superman run to date.

"Male looking for advice in gay relationship Me and my bf (also 24) have been living together for almost 2 years now, but I'm feeling like things are not working. We are constantly at each others throats to the point where it's almost normal to get in little fights around our friends. And whenever we go out and drink, we usually get into a big fight. But that is just the tip of the ice berg. I caught him using Grindr the day after my birthday (around May). I was furious to say the least. I saw that he had been doing this for months and asking guys to meet him in the bathroom with him. This was also the week before finals so I was extra stressed out already. I stayed at my parents house for a week and also went to get tested for STDs (which came back negative). My bf said that he didn't actually meet up with anyone and that it was just because he was horny... to this day I still am not sure... A few days later, I hooked up with a guy out of boredom/ revenge (I know that was completely stupid on my part). After finals, I went to go pick up my stuff from my bfs house when I started to feel guilty. I told him that I slept with someone else. Then we had sex and you know the rest.. We promised that we would never hide anything from each other. Lately, we've both been feeling bad about our relationship. I find it hard to trust him still. I keep going on his phone like I expect to find something. I'm not sure if I want to find something to give me a reason to leave or if I'm genuinely concerned he is lying to me. Our personalities are very different in some ways. He's a total extrovert while I like to focus on my hobbies and work on school. He gets easily upset when I have to change plans with friends because I can't go because of school. He says that I shouldn't complain because I don't contribute to the bills since I'm a full time comp sci student. My parents give me about 500 a month but that ends up going to gas/ food. The way he treats me is very annoying. It's almost like he demands that I love him when he acts like a child and he becomes very moody when I tell him how what he does affects me. I think this has to do with the fact he smokes two blunts a day. When he gets high, he's in his own little world. I can't ask him to help me with anything or understand even where I'm coming from. We've had problems with exes in the past too. One time when we were on a break (for throwing a sandwich at my face) I ended up seeing my ex to go out to a bar and drink. Nothing happened and I made sure of it. My ex was actually the one to tell me that it was silly to break up just for a sandwich slap. So me and my bf got back together and, being the guy that I am, told him that I went out with my ex. He was livid over that, which is understandable. Now whenever any of my exes texts me ""How have you been?"" I can't even reply with ""Hi"" but he is allowed to talk to any of his exes. My bf says it's because my exes want to get back together with me but I think it's just very hypocritical. He said that if I even said hi, we would be over. Now he's agreed not to talk to his exes but I also think he is just very sneaky about it. I'm not sure what to do. I just know that things could be better. Every time I try to say enough is enough I keep coming back. He's a good guy at heart but he can't seem to change. Any advice?"

Hotties with hand bras
Was I smoking weed and imagining things or were other other closeted guys testing the waters with weed? I need help deciding on whether or not I got high and I was seeing things/projecting or if other closeted guys were trying to reach out while we were high and if testing the waters with weed is something guys actually do. I was hanging with one friend and his buddy and we were high. Friend ends up doing pushups shirtless, looking back at me. There wasn't really any encouragement, mostly quiet, and it felt homoerotic, but I might be projecting. Later, I was peer pressured into a really effeminate slapbox match, which I found out of character for them. Even later, I heard the other friend briefly whispered and suggest something X rated in my ear, probably because of my wandering eyes focused on something it should've have. Another time, just my friend and me both high, were looking at his phone and he was scrolling and he scrolled past what looked like a bodybuilder, basically a really ripped guy, on his instagram, but I didn't address it. Even though I may be projecting, is getting high on testing the waters something closeted guys do? I've had people try to sneak things past me in a high group setting before. Thanks!

I don't want to have SRS because I don't see anything wrong with having a penis attached to my body. It doesn't seem disgusting to me, I am not repulsed by its presence, she and I get along fine and I enjoy her company. Underwear doesn't fit right, but that's not such a big deal. So I have no genital dysphoria, which is typically why people get SRS. A good many trans women have no genital dysphoria. SRS is a REALLY FUCKING BIG DEAL OH MY GOD. You have to get electrolysis on your penis first (though some surgeons use a better technique that doesn't require this), so that you won't have hair growing out of your vagina when the operation is complete. Then you get the operation, and for the next couple months or so your genitals have to heal, and the recovery process is pretty grim. Then for the rest of your life you have to dilate so that your body doesn't close up your vagina. There's also a risk of sexual dysfunction as a result. You only get SRS if, after taking into consideration all the aforementioned hassle and lifetime maintenance, you still think it's worth it. My not getting it is probably going to come back and bite me in the ass if and when I ever actually decide that I want to have a sexual relationship with any women (and right now I'm perfectly fine being single; I don't know if I have the energy to have a relationship), but meh, lack of sex is not exactly a major source of stress in my life. It used to be, back when I had a whole lot more Testosterone in my body, now though, meh.

"Haven't had sex in two months and I haven't felt better! As the title says, I haven't had sex in two months. And it's really no secret that people generally feel bad after hook ups or having sex with people that they don't know. One study states that ""78 percent of women and 72 percent of men who had uncommitted sex (including vaginal, anal, and/or oral sex) reported a history of experiencing regret following such an encounter (Fisher et al., 2012)."" And the reason for this regret is actually obvious: replacing what should be cherished partner with an anonymous piece of trash from a sex app is flagrant assault on basic values. Nearly all of my friends share this sentiment, too. So I don't understand why this cry is being shouted-out by ""slutwalks"" and ""anti-slut-shaming"" SJWs. The cognitive dissonance that results from regretting random sex and then preaching that one's life is better through anonymous sex must be crippling. Anyway, fuck the idiots who think visiting grindr or tinder or any of those dumpsters is normal behavior. Or maybe trash should go where it belongs? Who knows. It's okay to be ashamed of having sex. It's okay to regret it. It's okay to feel like a slut. This recognition is necessary for becoming a better person."

Graphics Cards Question Hello, I am new to PC gaming and feel I have a decent set up. CPU: AMD FX 8320 Eight-Core 3.50 GHz RAM: 16 GB RAM GPU: AMD Radeon R7 250 My issue is that my set up won't run any of my games at above 30 FPS, especially Arma 3, and to play any newer games at 1080p 60 FPS. All my research has lead me to the theory that I need to get a better graphics card. I have done some research on my own and came up with two options (price being a issue, trying to keep it below $300) 1) MSI GeForce GTX 1060 6GB or 2)XFX Radeon RS RX 480 8GB I was wondering what the PC Master Race thinks? I figured I would ask the experts. Thank you for your help and your input.

What should I upgrade? My current PC: AMD Phenom II X4 3Ghz, AMD HD 5770, 4GB DDR2 800Mhz. Was wondering why I get 25-35FPS in teamfights on League of Legends but can sit at 80+ frames during laning. My CPU and GPU should easily be able to not drop in frames on LoL so my RAM must be the problem. While im playing I still have 500mb RAM not being used so im unsure what the problem is.

On Amazon now about to buy the BenQ 144hz TN monitor, need some advice. I keep hearing that once I go to a 144hz monitor I will never want to go back. I will be connecting it to my Alienware 17R3. All that I really want is for the image quality and smoothness of my games to get better. Will I achieve this (to a degree) by getting this monitor? I'm running the GTX 980m and I can run Witcher 3 on high settings and get 70+fps. It looks good. If I connect the BenQ to my notebook via hdmi, will the image on the external monitor be noticeable better than the image on my Alienware's screen? I am new to serious PC gaming, the Alienware being my first rig. So your input is much appreciated as I try to get my system how I want it.

Why are VR headsets so expensive. hey there potential reader, I might be asking the wrong question or asking it in the wrong way,but why are they so Expensive,I mean its just a couple of screens,lenses and and some movement sensors and that's it,why the expense I really don't know maybe due to the R&amp;D but that was done with the Oculus DK1 and 2 didn't they get enough R&amp;D,I'm just mad cause I just don't know where the 600 dollars I paid for went.
Game Installations and Documents/username/My Games in 2 different partitions. Does it affect performance? Hi. I have a 1TB HDD and I'm thinking about sizing the C: partition at ~400GB and use the rest of the space as a D: partition for files (transferring the typical Documents, Images, Videos and Music folders to it. Since some games store their saves at My Games, subfolder of Documents, will the reading back and forth between partitions affect game performance?

She's also been off her loop and chasing the town for multiple episodes. Episode 8 doesn't even have the new narrative completed, with Sizemore working on what he thinks is the villain, and meanwhile the MiB has been playtesting this new narrative for multiple episodes already. We can't say definitively that she's in the present because that isn't what we've been shown.
Looking out of a ruin in outback Australia. Kind of looks like a picture frame on a wall.
"MiB knew Arnold, possibly even met him: **MiB (to Ford):** ""The man I'd be asking died 35 years ago. Almost took this place with him. Almost, but not quite, thanks to me."" That could even allude to the MiB having come to the park already **before** Arnold died. When William comes, Logan tells him that the partner killed himself ""right before the park opened"". The other possibility is that William learns about Arnold's fate in the season finale, ends up supporting the park financially to save it from freefall, and becomes MiB. If William is MiB, he didn't know Arnold personally."

Big Brother Over the Top - Wednesday Night Live Event Discussion - November 02 2016 On the live feeds tonight, beginning at 10p EDT/7p PDT, we will have a one hour recap of the past week. At 11p EDT/10p PDT, We will have a live eviction. If it's anything like last week, it will be very productionless and the HG will fill in for most of Julie's usual role. Starting at midnight/ 9pPDT, an HOH competition will be played. During the eviction, your best bet is to watch the Quad View. Who will be evicted? How will the votes fall? What awkward moment will we get from the live eviction? How about the weird 30 min of nothing after that and before HOH? Who will be crowned? Discuss all that and whatever else below.
Actually Justin, Scott told Alex and then Alex told Shelby.
If Alex goes home is it that terrible for Shelby's game? Morgan and Whitney are still bigger targets for the BS'ers since they can win an ACP. Jason and Justin are both huge targets. And if somehow Shelby is OTB and Morgan isn't yet wins ACP she may use it on her at DE. Idk just thinking of stuff.
Is Alex really going to go up by AN guys?
Is Shelby 100% nominating Whitney?
Jason knows Justin will most likely use the veto to save Whitney who according to him didn't give him as much information as he expected lol.
What if Justin is actually a Mensa member and he has been conning production and everyone in the house this whole time.
misses her sister?
I thought you meant a literal plant and I got excited to read why.
Looks like Justin is done with Jason: Justin talking to Kryssie (11/14 10:41am PT): I know you saying I could trust Jason, but I don't trust him anymore and I'm just over it. If he makes it to the end, it is what it is, but I don't trust him. You're the only person in this house that has never broken my trust. and I appreciate you for that. And that's why you will be one of the ones that I will take to the end. But I'm not taking him to the end with me. I just want you to know that...yeah because I've been thinking about it. He was the first person up there to them girls without Danielle and then they went up there as a pair. He was actually the first one up there without D, even though he wants to blame most of it on D, but he was the first person up there throwing me under the bus.
In a Justin/Kryssie/Morgan final 3, we're still voting for Morgan right?
"Tweet: @HeathLuman Glad to see the BBOTT schedule finally sliding up! HOH Comp goes live tonight at 10pm EST..... I think ""slide"" is a hint"
Let's be honest, regardless of if he tries or not, Justin can't win an HOH. It's just not possible. All of the comps have required some concentration and/or critical thinking skills. He is just too scatter brained to make it happen.
Why is Kryssie so mad? I thought she wasn't going to follow through with her plan anyways. She's really fuming that they don't believe her lies??????
I thought Danielle screwed up more than once?
Shelby grump cat staring at Justin for fucking up these questions lol
They gave Morgan pickles?! haha, Production is like, 'have a little have not with your HoH'
If Justin flakes on the CP task, then Shelby would be safe.
just a joke
I'm so glad her results aren't made public.
She blocked it out because it was too traumatic.
what am I missing here? how is 2nd place decided?

Big Brother Over the Top - Post-Season and Backyard Interview Discussion - December 01 2016 It's over! It's finally over! **Morgan Willet** won over Jason Roy. Kryssie Ridolfi was evicted in third place. Let's talk about BBOTT, the post-season interviews and whatever else you want.
I added Danielle to see this Shelby hanging out with Danielle deal, but I saw something different. They all got shuttled back together. Everyone went to their room. Then an Hr or so later They were all in the hotel lobby listening to Justin, Paul and Neely singing. Neely seems to be thirsting over Paul still. Then Alex got there and seems like Shelby left to her room.
Not Misspells-Definitley?
Alex, as you know in Big Brother houseguests are often tight-lipped about revealing strategy to other houseguests but feel free to be open about such things in the diary room since only America hears it. Given America's involvement, did you find yourself in the strange position where you had to lie or mislead America about your true intentions in your DRs to avoid votes going against you? Also, were any of your moves made merely to make Jason fans think you truly wanted to work with him more than you really did (I'm thinking of the four-person deal between you, Scott, Jason and Justin)?
Yeah Jordan wanted Jason to win because Morgan wouldn't care about the fanbase.
HAIL!
I'd kill myself too if I had to deal with her.
You mean *Real America*TM.
Did Jason really say his new alliance was BS? Did he tell the rest of the LTJ about it?

Shelby for care package?? I think she's the only Ball Smasher who would be voted out over Scott
Selective memory to create and perpetuate your narrative.
Is he wearing it or did he hide it?
Little does Kryssie know that if she nominates Scott she is inadvertently fucking over Neeley as he has the best shot of getting nominated by America.
it will be 3v5 by the next eviction if bs wins the CP
How dumb would it be for Morgan to leave herself on the block so everyone bugging her about how to use her veto leaves her alone? None of the BS would vote her out, and America won't vote her out.
she did and she got up and left!
Sweet Jesus,, why did they feel they had to cut to this conversation?
Are there Live DRs on America's Nom days?
At this point if noms stayed the same Scott doesn't go home. If Whitney and Scott are up together, Whitney has played herself out the door tonight.

Can we have different sensitivity options? And button schemes? I really wish we could get deprecate sensitivity options for different actions. Like ADS, wall running, and Titans. It's all very different going from one thing to the other. I dislike it all very much and I'm still not used it all. On the other hand I hate how I can't switch my Titan scheme. Right now I play Ronin with the evolved control scheme and use melee a lot with him. Sadly I NEED to crouch as a pilot to parkour. Yet in a Titan? Not so much... With Ronin I have to melee often which means pushing a button off my control sticks. Anyways does anyone else feel like this could help the game s lot?

It'll be interesting to see, a lot of people thought we'd have to choose between M.Floyd or Campbell but Floyd has made that decision for us. Campbell is an extremely good player and has developed really strong chemistry with C.Jones, but the improvement in his play also means he'll be looking for similar or improved pay. I think we'll see during FA and not before.

Which team will make the playoffs that you originally thought had no chance? The Dolphins and Raiders have surprised me. What teams are making you think twice about how good they are?
The 1997 49ers doubled down on the concept with Rod Woodson and Kevin Greene (and Chris Doleman, though he technically joined up in '96). Too bad we were well embroiled in an annual playoff Favreing at that point.

...he has a flair
If this were any other year Brady would be the unanimous MVP choice. However, I still think it's going to be very close because of what I believe some writers will still hold deflate gate over his head. He could very well win it and it pains me to say this but he definitely would have earned it and to me, the 4 game suspension and his numbers only add to his case. Ultimately I think it comes down to what the other candidates do in these last few weeks. For example let's say Rodgers and Matt Ryan ball out but their team misses the playoffs, this would eliminate them. If the patriots get the 1 seed and every other viable candidate misses the playoffs or has a couple bad games, It'd leave people no choice but to vote for him.

The bit about his visor is just nuts. The dude made a play completely blind, wow. I'll admit, it was nice to see Sherman being a little more nuanced in his evaluation of other players here. He acknowledges that he regretted his comment about Crabtree(?) after than San Francisco game, which was one of the few things he's done that really bothered me. And he says some nice things about Peterson as well. Great read here.

How come I can do 4x8 reps of pull ups but can only do 4x8 reps of 110 pounds of lat pulldowns? I weigh 160 pounds and have a decent pull up form starting hanging arms and finishing with chest at the bars.

I appreciate the responses folks. Do you have a suggestion for a program that focuses on general fitness and physique? My doctor told me that weight training can actually be beneficial to my joints as strengthening the muscles around my joints will help to protect them. I have been mostly sedentary my whole life and never lifted weights until now. I'm not interested in bodybuilding, and have already seen physical improvements like my shoulders and legs filling out and my belly fat is going away.
Let me know if there are any questions here. There seems to be a lot of misconception on how to use once of these things.
SL 5x5 people, if you work out MWF, what do you do on the weekend?
"""Practice good form until you're comfortable with good form."" Might have been a better way of describing it. Then he can move on to heavier weights and knowing how it's supposed to be correctly performed and what his ques are when he's uncomfortable. Knowing and recognizing what was flawed in his technique until he's comfortable is important, then he can apply that knowledge as he progresses. But you do learn a lot from being uncomfortable and a lot of knowledge and growth does come from that if you're aware of how to navigate it."

Sir, I understand you think you hardcore deadlifting 175lbs, but there's no need to slam the weights down forcibly as if to make a statement. QUIT BREAKING MY CONCENTRATION YOU FUCKING ASSCLOWN.
Romanian Deadlifts or Good Mornings? Hey fit! I do leg day twice a week and my main lift is squats for 5x5. If I was looking to blast my hammies would I be better off doing Good Mornings or RDLs? I can do more weight on an rdl so that seems like it would be it (more weight is always better right?) but I feel a bigger better burn in my hams after Goodmornings. Currently I do Goodmornings on the first leg day and RDLs on the second, but would I be better served to just pick one and do it on both days?
thanks for the article.
If it was anyone else, I would be on your side. However she's entitled to worry about you even when its completely unwarranted. Tell you mom you love her.
cardio is just as important for pull ups and chin ups
Are there any downsides in switching from SL(ie Ivysaurs Variation with bench on each day) to PHUL? Will the big lifts suffer or progress slower when not doing them anymore for three days/week? I want to switch to a 4 training day program and this lets me hesitate in doing that.

Didn't you hear? They're having you fight MM next this weekend. Good luck, champ
Page van zany? Sage Northcut? You don't think ufc invest more in some people? Sage get 100k per fight and is ranked #50 in the division. Plz have a personal reebok contract because she is hot and pushed by ufc. Don't be a. Fool.
What happened to Makdessi?
for a hook its pretty good i mean it doesnt look pretty but theres power behind those shots and they are going fast. I sure as hell cant throw hooks like that.
Wait it's really him?!!? Does someone have an explanation?
I saw this on YouTube comments as well can someone explain
The average guy can take as many steroids as he wants. You have to have actual talent to win fights still.
But those refs won't stop the fight until Fedor is dead and most of the bones in the body are crushed up.

Pow, right in the kisser.
I meant I'm undecided on who I want to win, definitely want the fight to take place!

Most insurance is an absolute scam. Like, it's their job to pay you as little as possible for things they ostensibly cover. It's an inherent conflict of interest.

Trust me they don't give a fuck that's all talk. It's just testosterone. A lot of older men take that shit all the time it's not even dangerous if you do it correctly. If it helps you win and win = money then to youre doing it.
Just wanna clarify that I am white, so I think she will be fine with me
Meh, I don't really gaf. I hear gun shots occasionally, probably like once or twice every few months. But then again I live in Vancouver, so nobody gives a fuck about us. And no, I don't live in the country. And yes, I grew up in gun culture so I know the difference about between fireworks and gunshots. Although I would say if I heard a big bada boom, I would be concerned. Thankfully I've never heard one of those on this side of the river.
I feel so bad when I see someone trying to talk some sense in emotion-driven threads.

why does it cost 200 dollars to increase the cpu by .2 GHz?
It's very well known that Yelp has been doing this for years.
Ok but this is the equivalent of when north korea does the human rights checks on itself. We did an investigation and we didn't do anything wrong.
The buying capacity of wages have dropped since WW2 when governments began devaluing currency. The 1945 minimum wage would now require the payment of 96 thousand dollars a year. The only actual wage increase post 1945 has occured at the executive level. 120k is in keeping with minimum wages increasing from WW2. Unless you can make all your own product you are obliged to remunerate equal shares for equal work.
It's about the median income in the US, so I really wouldn't say that it's high. In a historical context, when adjusted for inflation, it's actually lower than it has been. Salaries are slowly going down while the cost of living is increasing.
What does a new release cost? There are a few people saying they never use the codes. Maybe I had the wrong idea. But maybe it's the exceptions that prove the rule. I don't know either way. Would you say you represent the standard or the exception of vinyl buyers? But like I said before, records aren't portable, so if you never redeem the codes, that means that you never listen to those albums outside of your house, or you listen to them by other means, like streaming service.
They probably don't see the point now that single chip Xeons can scale to 22 cores.

the problem with tflops is they don't mean anything. As of right now there is no set industry standard to measuring them so they tend to be very skewed company to company. I believe Linus brought this up in one of the radeon 480 videos
Except you aren't accounting for the fact that I will eat that entire bowl of skittles. So 100% chance I'm screwed.
The only way to keep these plans remotely affordable as the costs continue to rise is for the government to increase the subsidies they're offering to lower income Americans. Which means that the reason these plans are affordable is because they're being subsidized by our tax dollars. So if we quickly review: Everyone has to buy health insurance or pay a penalty as a way to ensure that close to everybody is paying into the pot. And the only way we can make these plans affordable to lower income people is to subsidize them with people's tax dollars. So why the hell don't we just cut out the middle men, have everyone pay for a healthcare program directly through taxation, and cease with this inefficient bullshit? Rhetorical question because the answer is as obvious as it is depressing.

You might want to reevaluate how you assign stereotypes to people because you're wrong about me neckbeard as all hell. While you're at it, I'm sure there are a ton of other stuff in your life that needs attention and rectifying. It's a good thing you attempted to put this stranger in Reddit down, otherwise you probably wouldn't never known to proactively improve the low quality person that is you.
A bit of Talmudic logic, perhaps: * If you believe that what the Trump camp says about Hillary is false, then *you must vote for Hillary Clinton* because it means the Donald and his people are crazed, paranoid liars who don't know what they're talking about. * If you believe that what the Trump camp says about Hillary is true, then *you must vote for Hillary Clinton* because it means that even when crippled by a dozen different horrible diseases, she is still a Machiavellian genius who has masterminded conspiracies that penetrated most bodies and branches of the US government at all levels, most of the news media, and countless disparate organizations *around the world* such as (in Iraq) the official government, the Kurds, and Iran-backed militias (because they're all coordinating to attack ISIS together in the Mosul operation, which the Trumpists claim is occurring to boost Clinton's pre-election ratings). In other words, according to Donald himself, Clinton is everything that HE admires and aspires to in a leader (cf. his comments praising Putin, Saddam Hussein, and Kim Jong Un). It doesn't matter, does it? Either you choose the sane candidate over the batshit crazy one, or you choose the utter genius over the pale (but spray-tanned) imitator. Either way, Clinton is the only worthy pick. Vote.
He just renounced that yesterday.

My grandma had to use the Poise pads - not a full diaper but enough for a little oopsy pee. We went over and her apartment smelled *terrible* - it turned out she would use the pads once then set them on the edge of the bathtub and use the overhead heat lamp to dry them out to reuse. Gag! My mom had a fit but I thought it was kind of hilarious. Not gross, but she also had a huge thing for saving bags of bags, which I somehow picked up and also do. Like a reusable shopping bag with ten reusable shopping bags inside stacked on top of ten other bags of bags. After I inherited her whole stash I am *set for life*!!!

Petition calls for Donald Trump to take 5th-grade reading and math exams
Man, Jeb would've been in such a great position right now, it'd be unreal. Did you know that, way early on, he literally released all of his e-mails? Just went and released them all to the public in the name of transparency and openness. Didn't do much for him in the primaries, but that'd be real useful in the general right now. He'd probably be winning.
Sarah Palin. Not saying she was a great candidate, but I believe she is a decent person. The left slammed her non stop to paint her as a moron.
She claimed TBI and forgot all her classified information training.
Ideally Sanders would be leading the Social Dems, Clinton the Liberal Democrats, Rand Paul the Classical Liberals, Kasich the Conservatives, and Trump would run some nationalist America First party that all the others exclude from coalitions
Man, imagine if it did though. We'd have to teach our kids all about how a civil war got started because people worked themselves up on Facebook.

I'm truly surprised more of them aren't getting shot. I've got 2 friends and 5.56 ammo ain't exactly expensive. 3 competent shooters on the roof of a building are going to discourage the shit out of any looters once the bodies start stacking up. My only question is, if you wing them, do you keep shooting or let them bleed out.
No it's for real. Depending on what version of the Bible you have, it will read either dragon or serpent. They represent the devil in the book of Revelation.
C++. Really, just excell and matlab? Best advice, learn to code. The way this industry is now, if you dont know any programming languages, you are going to have a very very hard time. It's the future. You see what's happening with EE, its all computers now. Heck, I have seen it. I visited this plant, not going to say for which company, but lets just say its a very big company in the chemical industry. They have this assambly line, used to be staffed by people and workers on the plant floor. Not anymore, the power of arduino's and a simple computer program maintained by a small team of coders and one engineer to ensure the chemical part is working right. Same thing in a research station I visited two years ago, that is owned by a company, that uses it to monitor water, and salinity and stuff. They used to send a team, every week, to collect data, conduct tests, maintanance, etc. Thanks to simple coding and automated technologies, there was no need to send a team every week, just once a month, and now, its once a year to fix a loose screw or hardware issue, because the data gets sent to main base instantly, saving money on paying staff to go out and collect data for God knows how many hours. Its really sad Chemical engineering programs doesn't integrate computer programming into our learning, to better reflect the modern industry, yes, excell and matlab have their uses, but the way the modern industry is going, everyone should learn to code. Excell and Matlab are kid's stuff now (Though excell is a pain in the ass).I feel the things learned in a programming class will be more used in the real world, more so than my fluid mechanics or mass balance class.
Doesn't go present?
Withdrawing from two classes to switch major? Hi fellow students, I'm trying to make a decision soon and I was wondering if you folks could weigh in. I'm a current third-year chemE major with a minor in compsci and have recently come to the realization that I would enjoy studying and working in compsci more than chemE. Because of this, I've been trying to decide if I should drop my two chemE courses. If I drop them, I'd receive two W's on my transcript, but if I stay in them they're likely going to drop my GPA from a 3.3 to a 3.2 at least. My advisor told me that companies won't care about the W's because I'm switching majors, but I was wondering if you guys have experienced differently? I'm worried about the W's but dropping the classes would also free up time to pursue personal programming projects.
meh, same difference

Not to get all tinfoil but this is feeling like a major campaign oppo dump. 1. Reid sends a letter to Comey that pretty much accuses Trump of being a Russian plant. 2. Anonymous source says Comey didn't want to release info on Trump's Russia ties due to interference with the election. 3. The campaign has a conference call with reporters where they blast Comey for not releasing information on Trump's ties to Russia. According to reports they pretty much accused Trump of being a Russian plant. 4. Slate publishes a huge article on Trump's secret server communicating with a Russian bank. 5. MotherJones publishes an article with an anonymous opposition researcher who alleges that Russia has been grooming Trump for 5 years. Throw in Hillary's puppet comment during the debate and the groundwork for a massive dump on Trump's Russian ties has been thoroughly laid down.

This election has become an all out war on the clintons' everyday they come up with a different lie after lie to smear them. It's sad to see journalist not writing about facts instead write about falsehood. While trump have so many things they can write about for example bribing the attorney general Pam Bondi. That sound like pay to play to me. But they so focus on the clinton foundation and emails they all of a sudden forget that they have a job to do. It's appalling. They need to be called out for misleading the public with their blatant lies. Trump owes $650M in debt and yet no coverage on that. The fixation on the clinton is real folks and it's bad journalism at its core.

Trump's positions are actually pretty consistent if you take away the media spin. He's pro-life, wouldn't lose any tears if Row v Wade were repealed by the Supreme Court, but he'll allow the states to decide if they want abortion or not without interference. If you look at all the statements he's made on the subject, they're all consistent with that. On almost all issues he defaults to 'It should be up to the states'.

"I think it's more to do with the divide that's starting to occur in political thinking. Both parties had an opportunity to capitalize on it this time around, but Trump was (despite the GOP's best efforts during the primary) the only one that was able to see it through. Once ""Right"" and ""Left"" were fine, but now we're moving towards an era of ""Globalism"" and (not to be inflammatory since this word has a poor connotation) ""Nationalism."" Look at the Brexit vote, the love of populist candidates on both sides of the political isle, and impending vote for the French prime minister that is starting to echo the former two."

"Did you know that right now, you could plan a route to drive coast-to coast across America without driving through a SINGLE county that Hillary Clinton won. Sea to shining sea uninterrupted without hitting a SINGLE county that wanted Hillary Clinton to lead this country. If you tried to do the same trip using only counties Hillary won, you would only make it to central Nevada before reaching counties that voted for Trump, if starting from the west coast and would only make it as far as Pennsylvania if starting from the east coast, no matter which way you planned it. Please stop with this ""Hillary is the candidate of the people"" nonsense."
Good. We've had enough of neo-liberals betraying the American people for their money-lender masters.
Carrie Fisher on death in an interview last month: ROLLING STONE: Do you fear death? CARRIE: No. I fear dying. Anything with pain associated with it, I don't like. I've been there for a couple of people when they were dying; it didn't look like fun. But if I was gonna do it, I'd want someone like me around. And I will be there!
This could also be the thing that gets the Republic to stand against the first order openly with the resistance instead of only secretly supporting them.

I was on my way to dinner with my aunt, it was roughly 5:30 in the afternoon so the sun was still shining. We were driving down a populated road when I looked to my right, and on the sidewalk was a man. He was bent over, with his ass facing the road, taking a giant shit onto the sidewalk. I saw....everything. Parts of a man no woman wants to see, along with this biggest piece of human shit I have ever seen in my life. Needless to say, we never went to get dinner.
So let me get this straight. The suspect was carrying a knife, got in a domestic w/his daughter, his sister called the police, and he refused to follow the lawful orders of the police when they arrived....
Yep and the people of LA bought into the hype because for the last several years they really hyped the Rams coming back.
Liberal base reporting in. No alienation here. I'm A-OK with President Bush or any of the republicans coming out for Clinton. It's not about right or left - it's about putting country before party.

Up here in Chicago, IL and I've been seeing a ton of ads on TV for Hillary Clinton. I'm kinda wondering why though. Chicago is big enough and blue enough to dominate the whole state of Illinois, does Hillary really think she's in trouble here?
This whole article is about speculation on Trump. Ford didn't care who was going to be the next president when they announced they're sending all small-car production to Mexico. They're also not the only company to do so. Many, many companies are also shifting their manufacturing from China to Mexico. Mexico is not in trouble. When we start hearing of Mexican plants shitting down and moving to the US, it'll be something.
Thinking of Massachusetts corruption just makes me think of The Departed.
To be fair, Trump isn't a pathological liar, he's neurologically incapable of reality. Whatever spills out of his face hole is the truth of the moment, which somehow he manages to sincerely and utterly believe at the exact same moment that he's pulling it out of his ass.
"""Yes the war was great honey, I had to wear a bucket on my head and the soldiers made me wear life jackets"""
Maybe you should stop posting shit about David Duke for some non story attack on Trump that was resolved a year ago. Trump is not the one that brings him up and makes him mainstream, you and the media are. I should have no clue who this guy is and now he's a household name. Congratulations

"Is it considered ""slipping"" if you're purposefully saying and doing stupid shit?"
The casinos brought people and revenue into the city, but the city and state simply gobbled the money up -- they never put anything back into the Boardwalk, or build other, more modern attractions. The casinos were glitzy, and full of noisy slots, but a block away from the Boardwalk was the same urban blight and squalor that the casinos were built to combat. Once casinos in neighboring states started up, with better entertainment, dining, and other amenities, Atlantic City was finished. They had a great window, 20 years or more, but they never took advantage of it. Now, that window is closed, and they're paying the price for their perfidy. A lot of companies got killed when the bubble burst. Donald Trump's only get mentioned because his name was the biggest one there.

Nah... we will stay home. FUCK those who openly endorse corruption with a vote.
They picked someone that tapped into their anger and resentment. People knew in the GOP and there were people in the GOP that definitely cared and spoke out, but when there is that much anger backing a candidate there tends to be a lot more leeway that allows for someone like Trump to make it through. When people are angry they are not exactly rational.

Can we just take a step back and appreciate the hubris it takes for someone like Donald Trump to run for president and think that this stuff wouldn't surface or that it wouldn't matter? Not just the sexual assault stuff, mind you. All of it.
"You guys never, ever ask for citations for any Trump bullshit ""scandals"". Hillary Clinton is hands down the worst, most evil candidate EVER to run for the office. Even if the mainstream media DOES take down Trump with every personal attack in the book, if they have any left which Im sure they do, Democrats will be stuck with the worst president ever being attached to THEIR party."

Not terribly shocking at all, nor is the ignorance of many of his supporters. It's satire turned into reality, we could have the fake-moon-landing and flat-earth folks pop up and declare their undying loyalty to Trump this afternoon and I wouldn't even be the slightest bit surprised.
"I had a ""death phase"" when I was around 11 after my grandfather died. I remember staying up all night, wondering what it meant to stop living, and if it meant in turn that you stopped *being*.

Have a look at Singapore, it takes charging for cars to a whole other level. Though it's not perfectly comparable as space is at a premium there. People must first buy a certificate of entitlement, it's sold through auction, regularly goes for prices north of $50k, lasts 10 years and grants the right to own a car. The car itself comes with a 100% tax on the market value of the car. A $30k car will cost over $110k to get on the road. Then there are congestion charges.

Before
The Rabbit (Short Story) There it was, the red-rimmed glass door of Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. The place I loved as a kid, the place I was getting ready to apply at. I opened the door and closed the umbrella I was using to shed myself from the torrential downpour. Can't be having my nice shirt getting wet right before the big interview. I dried my polished black shoes on the small mat just inside of the pizzeria. I fidgeted with my shirt, trying to get it to have as few wrinkles as possible. I took a deep breath and continued walking. My interviewer would greet me soon, I knew it. I mentally prepared myself. I turned a corner and found myself in the dining area. I glanced to the stage. An animatronic was missing. How... curious. I turned back around to see, sitting down at one of the dining tables... Bonnie. His arms laid out in front of him, with his characteristic human hands outstretched on the placemat. He screeched a greeting. After a heated interview involving a lot of tooth gnashing and screeching, I apparently got the job. I think. As I left, I glanced to the show stage once more, noting that the animatronics looked the same. Freddy with his bear mask, tuxedo, and cane. Chica, with her manly stubble under her mask, large stature, and white wife-beater. The clothing item, not the criminal offense, by the way. Everything seemed perfectly normal. I left the building, began to enter my car, got hit by an airplane, and died. The end.

Same! Especially food you just bought. I spent $2.50 on a lean cuisine out of a vending machine at work last week. It was meal I'd never tried before, but after I cooked it, the smell made me sick to my stomach and I threw the whole thing away. It felt like throwing $2.50 in the trash. Sadly from experience, I know if a smell makes me queasy, trying to eat it only makes it worse.

On a lot of motorcycles, there are several clutch plates bathed in crankcase oil. Aka wet clutches. On motorcycles with wet clutches, you can slip the clutch A LOT and it does virtually nothing to clutch life. The plates are bathed in oil which cools them, among other things. There are a lot of advantages/disadvantages to both, but the point is slipping a clutch isn't particularly harmful to a wet clutch. A lot of riders will constantly slip the clutch on their bike and use their back brake to modulate speed in slow traffic. Imagine how hard that would be on a dry clutch, or car clutch.

I have a lot of hope and respect for KB for what he's done and can do moving forward, but I hope Proehl absolutely CHEWS HIS ASS this week."
It's crazy what a few poor games can do to this sub As the Panthers sit at 1-3 this sub is imploding. I get that's the nature of the beast, but damn people are doing 180's left and right. The echo chamber is rolling hard right now. I really don't wanna seem like I'm criticizing too much, but we can't lose faith in the squad. We have to have the Keep Pounding mentality. Healthy analysis of the team is always a good thing, but we're getting borderline salty around here.
I was in 10th grade when the panthers whooped up on the cowgirls in the playoffs. Awesome times!
I guess the word on this guy was that he was consistently caught out of position and that made him a liability in run defense. They felt more comfortable with Wes Horton I guess.

Look, I am no fan of Trump. I come from a family of Democrats, New Dealers, been a Democrat all my life. I even voted Bill Clinton 2x and Obama once. However, when I saw the fundamental damage to Clinton's did and their Third Way friends were doing I began to openly question my political identity. If there is a singular policy reason for Hillary's loss I would point to NAFTA which was a terrible Easter Egg left behind by the feel good late 90 Clinton days that is still doing damage today. Then Obama tried to expand it. More and more Republican style economic policies and corruption piled up I just couldn't support that anymore. Bernie offers a great opportunity for both economic and social reform. He will be the biggest friend of minorities in the Trump era.
Well then get ready for the next four years! /vomits.

She is true to her idealistic values. I will give her credit for that. She has some good points, and while most of us don't think her ideology is very practical, it's still a valid view and I am glad she represents it.
I get that too, I don't think she's oblivious. But stubborn? Absolutely.
"He should have gone home for that outfit (and those *fucking* Mickey Mouse clipped-ear shoulders!) but it was just cruel the way Heidi revealed it to him.

Just tell both of them that they are both out at the same time and be done with it."
You're right. Also they had one week with no eliminations plus the Tim Gunn save so they had to do a double elimination to keep within the correct number of episodes.

Well, according to the bros, there was every bad article about Bernie, the reports that his demographic was mostly young white folks, and the very existence of bros themselves.
Jesus Bern Christ held more rallies for Clinton than she did herself!!
Like...I think the Busters refereed to in that comment are certain Democratic Electors (think there were two) who pledged not to vote for Clinton even if she won the EC. So they are now behind convincing other Democratic Electors to switch their votes over to another Republican. Am I remembering this correctly?

They really like to think that NY Times and Washington Post are hyper liberal. I grew up in a rural town and have tons of friends / acquaintances that believe this, hell even some family, yet i went to college and have tons of liberal friends and legitimately less than 1% of them would think that. I dont know if this is just my specific circles or if this denial-ism is more deeply rooted in the republican side. It's frustrating though because you cant even have conversations with them because they throw out all your facts as ""lies and conspiracies against the republican party perpetuated by places like WaPo and NY Times."""

"Proposed Zarya Nerf I think everyone agrees that right now in the current meta Zarya is a bit too strong. She is an auto-pick at pretty much every rank from gold and up. Currently on PTR there is a nerf in line to reduce the damage boost she receives from bubbles, and while that may work well I often don't like nerfs that are ""make them weaker, make them slower"" and inversely buffs that are ""make them stronger, make them faster"". I would rather see subtle buffs/nerfs that don't change the stats of a character as much as their functionality. So here is my Zarya nerf proposal. It's very simple and straight forward. Have her bubbles consume ammo from her gun. The bubbles already come from her weapon, so it fits lore/flavour wise that it would function this way. This forces Zarya to conserve ammo more, be aware of her ammo amount and tactically reload more often. As a result you maintain her power level but increase her skill cap and force to to work just a bit slower than before. What do you guys think? **TLDR**: Have Zarya's barriers consume her weapons ammo when applied."

I didn't really think about what this DOB would be used for, so I didn't record it. As it turns out, DOB is needed to reset your PTC password. I got logged out of PoGo recently and needed to reset my password, but cannot reset my password due to not knowing what the DOB I set. I've contacted support (not Niantic, the support through pokemon.com) but haven't heard back, so I was wondering if any redditors did something similar, or have heard if they'll change your DOB?

Then the rest of the article is about ""simply passing a joint"" to a minor, which is a big deal, even under Prop 47. That's like passing the bottle to a minor. Moving the Legal age from 21 to 18 isn't what this proposition is about. Don't let them fool you into thinking it's a failed proposition. It's actually very well planned."

I had the edibles at 3pm and they kicked in at around 4pm. The period of time from 4-8pm was filled with involuntary muscle spasms (somewhat soothing), questioning my thought process on why five edibles were a good idea for a first time, and lastly wondering what the FUCK was going on. How could a human being be *that* fucking high? These days I just take one brownie if I'm going out or half of one if I'm looking to just chill and play video games.
I'm a Sanders supporter. If she takes a position in the Trump administration, I will vote *against* her in the Democratic primary. Even if Hillary Clinton decided to try yet again.
They're going to do it every single season, and contestants better get used to it. ABC's goal is ratings, because ratings make money. By 'leaking' several potential leads, they can watch for public reaction via social media. It sucks, but the producers will sell a pack of lies to every potential lead, but until ABC makes an official announcement, it's only a possibility.

Why does everyone go to college nowadays? I'm going to be a comedian and I have $3000 saved up for me to move to NYC and get a studio apartment somewhere in queens or Brooklyn once I get a job I can save some more. I'm not going to go to college but I figure I'd get some cushy job to keep me afloat and do comedy at night. All my other friends plan to go to college so they can get a good job and have a good life and I get that but I think good job and college aren't mutual.

The Miami teams around '99-'03 were just unbelievably stacked. What's crazy is not only that they had great college players, but that so many of them became NFL standouts as well. Ed Reed, Shockey, Gore, Reggie Wayne, Santana Moss, McGahee, Portis, Winslow, Andre Johnson. Jesus. Butch Davis may be a corrupt cheater, but you can't say he doesn't know talent. Unbelievable recruiting. By the way, their new kid Mark Walton looks like a sicko. Duke Johnson was okay, but this guy looks like the best RB they've had since Gore left.

What do you guys think of the possibility of Legends upgrade sets for older legends? With the new bundles and legend program there has been a lot more collectibles and gold cards flooding the market on the weekends. What are your guys thoughts on them releasing sets that take say 2 Dallas Clark's and Either upgrade his stats to a possible 92 OVR or maybe give him a secondary or possibly a third chemistry? EA has been known to release sets to help clean up the auction house of flooded players. Just A thought, would love to hear everyone's opinion on the matter
Really ? I thought it was higher. Thank you

Thanks for any feedback.
Zedruu The Ambivalently Hearted
I really like the card, but no part of it feels red to me. The card draw is blue, the helping opponents is white, and the potential ramp is green, but where's the red? And the P/T is as non-red as it gets.

Hearthstone Cards as cookies So I'm new to reddit and found a disappointing lack of comparisons between hearthstone cards and biscuits/cookies. I can sort out some of this, but I've not used all the cards enough to know all of them. [[Medivh, The Guardian]] - Short bread; might not intially feel amazing, but keeps you full better than most other biscuits/cards. [[Loatheb]] -Rich tea; used to be everywhere, but I've not seen any in Colombia. [[Medivh's Valet]] - Gingernut; fine on their own, but with that secret ingredient/tea they are amazing [[Yogg-Saron, Hope's End]] - Pre nerf, selection box; they all look great, but sometime it will end badly for you. - Post nerf, a smaller selection box Any other suggestions?

What to grind for... Enjoying this game so far but I was wondering what you guys are grinding for? I've noticed this game requires a lot of time and grinding to unlock high level things which is cool, but I'm unsure of what to actually go for. Camos, variants, nuclears etc. Any suggestions?

"Good news- PP's still gettin better. Bad news- I still to have wait more for his return. The hell am I supposed to do until then? ...Oh yeah. Write PPMD fanfiction. Ahem: The hazy, mist-kissed rays of the North Carolina sunrise reveal an unremarkable log cabin in the hills. Inside, there is only a sleeping bag, a CRT and a Nintendo GameCube set up with a copy of Super Smash Bros. Melee. Here, the mythical figure himself, PPMD, trains in solitude. Time has since lost its traditional meaning- the days and nights march on with a perplexing stillness not unlike the usual endless practice sessions on Battlefield. Occasionally, the Doctor must secure a meal, and to aid him with this task, he has manifested astral projections of his loyal companions, Falco and Marth. The local Fox population provides adequate nourishment, and upon returning to his cabin, the Doctor is greeted by the crimson blur of a cook fire- masterfully cut by the swordsman prince's tippers, and brought to flame by the avian ace's up-b. He eats his meal in comfort. Such is the existence of PPMD. A retreat of peace, reflection and self-improvement. The silence broken only by the sounds of the routine hunt, and a methodical clacking of control sticks and buttons. However, this night is different. The Doctor opens the door to his cabin, as he senses a disturbance near his abode. The darkness of the mountain night gives way to a brilliant blue light. Blip... blip... blip. A repeating noise accompanies the flashes as they continue to approach. The Doctor knows of this light, for Falco is one to use it. But he searches his thoughts- ""That aint Falco."" And then, not one, but two figures reveal themselves. The Fox lord himself has come, with his shining Fox and a GameCube controller in tow. To take revenge on their ravaged population. Their eyes meet, and the GameCube whirrs to life on its own. They know what is coming... *Find out what happens next time on PPMD and Hax$'s Bizarre Adventure*"

The difference is through the MIR though. Would that still count as a discount? I thought it only mattered if the base price went down
I think spending an extra 15 bucks for a 2gb 950 would be a better choice. Still a decent deal though
The game is actually a lot of fun, and the gunplay is amazing.

"There have been two pieces in the Wall Sreet Journal alleging a fight between FBI investigators vs the DOJ and FBI leaders over whether to aggressively inestigate the Clinton Foundation. The FBI investigators were essentially only using the Bannon funded oppo piece ""Clinton Cash"" as the predicate for the investigation. The leadership at the DOJ and FBI didn't think that was valid evidence to warrant an investigation. Now the aggrieved FBI agents that didn't get to aggressively/publicly pursue the investigation of the Clinton Foundatino have leaked their version of the story to press. in this case, the WSJ. The same reporter is covering it that did another dishonest FBI oppo hit against the Clintons thta was publicly debunked by the DOJ."
Secret Recordings At Center Of FBI Feud With DOJ Over Clinton Foundation Probe
No, the media just loves scandals, as that's what sells.
I don't care what people are saying about Comey. I know the polls were showing a tightening of the race before the Comey nudge, but I think he closed the gap fully and then some. If Trump wins this election, I will forever see Comey and the FBI as the entities that created this mess and are to blame.
I kind of doubt it will. Donald Trump's spouting of the Putin line on everything to the detriment of US and allies interests has been blatant for over a year. People don't seem to move based on foreign policy considerations. It has to be a character thing apparently for people to give a shit.
Another FBI leak.
Is it too far out there to say that the FBI might have been the ones doing the bugging?

Oh I know. But anything that wikileaks does that isn't directly related to the candidates will get removed.
They don't care about the economy. They care about the next fiscal quarter. Their job is to make money, and this is the best way for them to do that right now.

He would eventually turn us into 3rd world or Russia economically speaking, but before that we would be a very very powerful rogue state, literally the scariest thing for Americans everyone else in the world.
I'm fairly new to hanging in r/politics (trawling through r/asoiaf has been eating up way more of my time), so I don't know whether this idea has been discussed to death already. And full disclosure, excluding the TVs around my office that are always tuned in I don't spend a lot of time watching cable news. Can you imagine the shitstorm that would follow one of Clinton's surrogates saying something this ridiculous? Panels of hacks would convene to discuss her competence ad nauseum for letting someone like this get within a mile of her campaign. It would obliterate public anxiety about her physical health, and we'd probably hear about new developments in the Kathygate Millergate scandal well into October. So far the only major outlets covering this are the Guardian and the Washington Post. I even searched specifically for CNN and MSNBC coverage, and neither has mentioned Kathy Miller very much over the last few weeks. Ratings tend to be higher when an election is a neck-and-neck clash with high stakes, I get that. The way that the press should treat issues like this seems pretty uncontroversial to me too: a few of my relatives are journalists, and I've worked as an editor for a centrist policy journal. Are outlets like CNN so narrowly focused on creating the illusion of objective coverage that they're treating such a ridiculous race as an evenly matched election? That's honestly the only reasonable explanation I can come up with. I wish the the infernal media conspiracy that CTR has wrapped around its eldritch tentacles would get its act together, because I'm getting worried.

How strong do you have to be to do the 3rd event run + General Q's So I've been playing a little over a week now and just recently had a power creep since I rolled a Luneth, I can easily beat the 2nd stage of the event but get completely rekt on the 3rd. My team as of now is: Luneth -5- lvl 70 Exdeath -4- lvl 36 Kain -4- lvl 52 Arc -4- lvl 50 Krile -4- lvl 42 (my healer) Gear wise -Just beat the White Dragon (sword on luneth), Chimera destroy's me -cleared Adv Crystal tower and got all the chests in the middle that I can Should I just progress on the story? - Just unlocked 3rd Island or carry on farming the Metal cactuar from this event since its essentially 8 energy for 30k xp which is what I've been doing to level my units. Should I level other units or is my current team good? Other unique units I have are: Rydia, Celes , Tellah, Cerius, Maria, Shantotto, Cyan, Anzelem, Penelo, Shadow, Galuf, Freya, Ignus, Clyne, Edgar, Russel and Beldie - Used most/all lapis on rolls and have loads of dups on the second row and bellow
What other units did they have other than Vargas?
Why Black Friday bundle isn't too bad While you f2p might complain that the only thing worthwhile in the bundle is the summon ticket, you guys might miss the big picture. Since it's basically 350 for a summon ticket, we must compare it to half price pulls. Sure it's a little more expensive, but you get to hoard those tickets for an orlandu banner or for any other of your favorite characters. For instance, I can get 7 tickets from the Black Friday bundle for about 2450 lapis. Those can be used for the orlandu banner (when you are on the last day of the banner and you ran out of half price pulls). The 2450 you spent on the Black Friday bundle would get you about 2 more chances at orlandu compared to the almost 5 pulls you could get using 500 lapis summon. Not to mention the star quartz and energy that comes along with the bundle. In my opinion, even though the Black Friday bundle isn't as good as we could have hoped, it is still good for hoarding for a good banner
I have like 5 earth keys and 0 motivation to get them all... i rather level 3 of my 8 exdeath.
~~chokeslam~~ &lt;3 I'd be ok with that. I'm basically resigned to never getting him at this point anyhow. He's the one.... that got away
Ive gotten 5 exdeaths but no butts, who I was looking for. :( Trade ya?
Ahh I disagree. Maybe I'm just fixating a bit too much.
Ah, see I never really stick around on the home page... I usually click straight through to whatever I need using the nav bar within a few seconds... But now that you mention it, it *did* used to show some of the announcement banners &amp; such didn't it... I wonder if those are listed somewhere else now..?
Pff all these fancy base 5 i will just wait for aura or agrias 6*:
Yeah. Ramza's pretty low-tier as far as 5* base units go until his enhancements actually roll in. But when they do... hoo boy. My team will be set for awhile.
What would you do if FFBE servers permanently shut down?
You've been playing too long, you're starting to think like an FFBE character!

And when you least expect get TGC
Is this game basically Brave Frontier? The title. I've played Brave Frontier quite a bit but grew tired of it and quit. I recently saw some ads for this game and saw that it's also developed by Gumi. Is it just a copy of Brave Frontier with Final Fantasy characters and theme or is it a different and unique game? Sorry if this is already addressed in a sticky or something I did a cursory look for one but I'm on the mobile app (which I'm new to navigating) and couldn't find one. Thanks for any replies.
That would be VERY few failed runs then, his total score is less than .1% of the group score so far. That would mean Frostor lost 99.9% of the time.
"I don't see how OP is being an asshole. It's not like he's saying ""people who have opinion which is but like mine is stupid and should fuck off"" like you did."
"Yeah that was the first game that really drew me into the characters. I didnt play a lot of the other final fantasies until emulators came out because a bunch of em didnt have an ""official"" US release iirc."
"I talk about Firion a whole lot and here's why It was pointed out to me that I talk about Firion a whole lot and how good of a character he is despite being like a 7 or 7.5 on the wiki's unit tiers. Here's the thing. By himself, Firion is not glorious. But, it often comes up in the context of TM rewards and what to farm for. Firion is maybe the best clean slate in the game to build on. He doesn't have the ATK of CoD or Garland but those two have no ability slots. Firion has 4. You can slap Barrage and Dual Wield on him and he can become a living god of destruction. He can equip every single weapon in the game. Almost everyone has or will eventually have a Cecil, Locke, Miyuki or Kain. Especially Kain, the gacha seems to really love him. I have a ton of Kains and eventually I'll be launching Project Gungnir, and stockpile those damn things. Anyway, point being... Maxed Firion has 102 base attack, 3 ""Killer"" passives natively and he can equip anything in the game except heavy shields (and who cares about shields with an offensive unit anyway). He also becomes a powerhouse with his 6* upgrade, and is one of the higher rated units at 6* out of what we currently have in Global. Not as high as WoL, but hell, he's higher than Chizuru. If you have an army of Barrage units, use those instead (I do, I have 2 Firions I'm not even using right now, but I'm leveling them) but if you don't, or if you are TM farming, keep him in mind, you'd be amazed at what you can do with him. I've got a friend with a 450+ attack Firion dual wielding Sakurafubuki and Rising Sun with Blade Mastery from Chizuru and it's nasty as hell. You can also slap Doublehand on him, equip the highest +ATK gear in the game that you can find, and throw on Excalibur for about the same amount of ATK. Firion owns."

Probably Sephiroth. I refuse to taint his greatness with *my* weak builds. He should equip *ONLY* the best TMs.
mad cause its not a girl?
The message wasn't that tanks weren't needed. The message was that tanks weren't needed in CURRENT content. That doesn't mean you shelve the tank and never level it up. It means you don't bring it to Intangir, Brachiosaur, or even the FFT event. But by all means, level one up in the meantime because obviously they will be needed down the road.
I'm also F2p. If you have a good team, cecil LB lvl 25 won't matter because you'll already be able to clear content. If you have a decent team, cecil LB lvl 25 won't matter because you'll already be able to clear content with proper strategy. If you have a bad team, cecil LB lvl 25 won't matter because it won't push you through the threshold of being able to clear the content. It's a nice increase in stats but it's also **incredibly niche.** The number of actual practical situations it'll save you in is probably miniscule. I can imagine the number of situations it'll save you in to be less than 1%. For that amount of effort the payoff just isn't that big for most people.
Why do people keep calling her VLC Fina?
Sorry, I was just curious as to exactly why she was OP. So I would know whether or not if maxing her was worth my time. I appreciate the response.
If you macro then saving time is irrelevant; and uses less base energy (and hence refills) than these moogles.
Nice, my 5 Chorizos are ready.
You seemed to lose quite a few with that one message though...
It means that you can tap your screen 200 times or so while watching tv, driving, working, or whatever you're doing throughout the day. Farming trust manually is painstaking and I commend anyone who sees a unit through from 0-100%. I made it to about 25% w/ Zidane before I threw in the towel and learned how to switch control. Best decision I've made with this game.

Keep saying that. Your diabetes hurts no one but yourself. My husband was almost on the floor some days, blurry vision, lightheadedness, confusion, nausea, frequent bathroom trips. He had no idea that he had high sugar until he went to the doctor and got a come to Jesus speech and a glucose monitor. He can CLEARLY tell whether his sugar is up or normal now because normal feels good and high feels disorienting. If that's your everyday mode of operation, your life must suck. And when you lose a foot, I'm sure that'll just be bad doctors stealing your money, too.

They do: and in America that probably does apply to some extent because of the proximity to Mexico and large number of Spanish speakers in America. But in the UK, why would I need Spanish? I've got virtually no contact with South America (where most of the Spanish speakers are), and Spain has high numbers of English speakers because of British tourism. Not to mention the fact that 2-3% of Spain's population are British expats anyway. Chinese is an option, and there are increasing Business ties with China: but I'm yet to actually come into contact with any of those business ties: they still make up a fairly small proportion of business in the UK

The team reportedly wants to carry eight defensemen in the NHL, so the locks are Edler, Tanev, Gudbranson and Hutton. The next three most likely are Sbisa, Larsen and Tryamkin. The first two are on one-way deals and Tryamkin will flee the interview to Russia if he's sent down, apparently. So, the eighth spot goes to either Stecher, Biega or Pedan, I guess?

I'm sure there are even a few out there who will associate him more with Team Canada or the Phoenix Coyotes than the teams mentioned. Curious to see what r/NHL thinks.

I don't know too much about the details (just the basics really) and I recently got my first job which means I'll finally have money to build my first pc. Can someone just give me an average cost of a good build? I'm not looking for something that'll run Ultra High settings but something average.

I'm pretty sure he advocates taking them both into account equally. At least, I've never heard him describe himself as a negative utilitarian. Although I think that even if you are taking both things into account, people typically have much stronger preferences to get themselves out of suffering than to gain more pleasure. Like if someone was starving to death, feeding them would probably be more a net positive than giving any average citizen in the West like $200,000. But this is were utilitarianism is difficult to get perfect answers from haha.

Christianity is *supposed* to be liberating with Jesus fulfilling the Old Covenant on our behalf. The Church has been swallowed up by the same legalism that Jesus railed against with the Pharisees. The New Covenant only has two rules - love God in everything you do and love your neighbour as yourself. Live with love and grace and Jesus will surely welcome you when the time comes.

I work as over the phone tech support for a public university. During the months of December and April/May is when I get the most helicopter parents. Each student has a security question attached to their account, but this one parent was bound determined to get into his daughter's accounts, as he kept giving incorrect answers to the question. No correct answer = No account info given/comprehensive assistance given. The call lasted for at least thirty minutes and included but was not limited to: - Threatening Lawsuits - Excessive Swearing - Several pieces of office stationary being slammed into the callers desk over and over. The call finally ended with a swift pass to my supervisor, who just repeated everything that I had said. Needless to say that as one of my first calls in telephone support, this was definitely one to remember. I understand that if you pay the bills you want some sort of access, but all that we can legally give is joint access to the bill pay site.

Can't figure out the name of a movie. Idk if there is a subredit for this but I'm trying to figure out the name of a movie.

Movie goes on and the kids are adults and one is evil and the other isn't and I think they end up fighting each other? Anyone have any idea?

If the Twilight Saga had been written by a man, how much dislike could have occurred as a result? While it's understood that lots of people see lots wrong with the series, the fact that it was written by a woman makes me assume that the level of dislike (I think hatred is a whole different thing) was contained. If a man had been behind it, how might it have turned out. I mean the exact same story, nothing different, 100% as it is, but penned by a man.

Help finding a new RPG to play So I am looking for a game that can hold my attention. Aspects I would really enjoy are things like Enclaves ranged combat system. In Enclave your enemies armour was layered, and had gaps so the damage was decided by whether you hit the plate, the gap in the armour etc. At the time the game released the damage system, accompanied by the array of different arrows you could fire made the ranged game revolutionary for me. KOTOR opened my mind up to realtime strategic combat. I would be very interested in another party based real time rpg. Morrowind had a really diverse magic system so I would always be open to something with an interesting magic system. To summarise, I am looking for any one of, or any combination of: An interesting and innovative ranged combat system. A tactical combat game involving strategy and party based play. A game with an interesting an innovative and worthwhile magic system. Any one of the above would be a welcome suggestion. Thanks in advance to any who give thought to my question.

The refs really affected how this game played out. Curry didn't shoot great but he had a huge impact just being on the floor (+10 when all the Warriors, except Iguodala, was negative). If those two bullshit fans weren't called on him, Warriors would've won. With that said though, I made $50 beating the spread. Sorry Warriors fans, I just had a feeling you would get killed in offensive rebounds and in transition.

Him and Cassano are very different. Cassano constantly clashed with coaches and chairmen, would often come back overweight from vacation etc. Balotelli's main problems are immaturity off the field and not taking the whole football thing seriously. He was never mean in his incidents unlike Cassano. I don't think he had any major incidents in Liverpool and 2nd spell in Milan, from what I can remember. He was a horrible fit for Liverpool's playing style and injuries and the whole team underperforming wrecked him in Milan last season.

The scalp thing is what gives me my theory of the hair discrepancy of Lawrence. I don't believe that it was an error in terms of the re-shoot. I think it is evidence of separate timelimes. I think it changes because Lawrence is one of the people The MiB scalps in order to find they maze. The scalp may have gone missing so in the other timeline the crew may have had to use a different scalp to patch Lawrence up resulting in a different hairline ( we already know that they are sloppy)

I can never see the value in hum when you have roadside assistance for $3.00. my other gripe is that you only get 10 miles for a tow while on AAA is 100 miles.

Black Friday deals and adding a line I see that the S7 will be discounted to around $10 p/m on the 24 month plan. Is that only available to new accounts or can i add a phone to my account for the $10 deal? basically making it $30 instead of $40+?

Options swapping Note 7 for iPhone 7 I have a Note 7 that I need to give back for the recall. This has to be done by 9/30 or I lose out. I want to trade for an iPhone 7. Problem is I can't get to the store Friday until after 6pm. I'm assuming the store will be sold out by then. When should I try and go. Would Saturday or Sunday be too soon? Thanks!
Note 5 vs Note 7 - same price? Why is the Note 5 and Note 7 the same price, $299? Actually the 7 is better because it has 64GB for $299 vs the 5 that only has 32GB for $299...seems like the 5 needs t come down in price.
oops. thought i saw it wasn't possible and you had to buy direct off contract.
What is the cheapest plan I can get if I have a Galaxy S7 paid off?

Phone payment question The wife and I are due new phones. If you do the finance option, can you pay the phones off early? I get an annual bonus in December that I could pay the phones off with.

Trade in/insurance help Bought a note 5 a little over a year ago with full insurance, when I first got it I had problems with it freezing up then restarting (not fully just to where I would have to use a pattern not fingerprint to unlock it) but was too lazy too bring it in. The phone is paid off and for physical damage only has one scratch how should I handle trading it in for a pixel? Deal with the insurance side first? Or do the damages not matter?
Huh? A prepaid plan on Verizon with 10 gigs? For $70? Since when?
New Pixel XL - Company Name ID and HD Calling Incompatible? I just got a new Pixel XL and noticed the Company Name ID feature was removed from the line for some reason. I went to re-add it and it gave me an error saying it couldn't be added. After talking with Verizon they are saying that HD Voice and Company Name ID aren't able to work together on the Pixel until some software updates happen. Has anyone else heard of this or know why this may be an issue? Seems like with a brand new, up-to-date device, I should be able to use both of those features together. It worked on the iPhone 7 Plus I came from. Hmmm.

Solo queue quick play is literally cancer
Remember the fifth of November So let's be honest, sombra probably won't be released today. So another theory of the obvious release at blizcon. We all know junkrats name is Jamison Fawkes. Guy Fawkes plotted to blow up parliament on November 5th. Sombra has been trying to reach Junkrat via hacking of a moment of crime... or maybe after all this time Sombra is just the idea behind the revolution.
Sombra today's leak - Volskya If you go on Volskya map on PTR this sombra procol monitor dissapeard and in this today's artwork sombra is at Volyskya. What do you think guys ?
Official forums are all going to boo blizzard at blizzcon Bunch of upvotes on their posts too, are we doing that too?

I think the competitive season sprays and icons are too easy to obtain. I don't think that you should get it just from playing 10 games, it should be a system like Hearthstone where you have to reach a certain rank before you can get them (to be fair that Hearthstone rank is very easy to obtain but it's something). Right now I don't want to use any of the competitive cosmetics I obtain (maybe except Golden guns but I think they're in a good place) because they're so common, everyone has one - i'd LOVE to see some cosmetics you could only get from getting to a certain rank or getting a certain amount of gold medals in comp or something along those lines. I think it would add more reason to play competitive as well, because right now it's mainly bragging rights for saying you got that high (and golden gun points). Anyway to sum up I'd love to see some sort of system where you can get cool skins or icons or sprays for playing well as opposed to just playing. Maybe i'm just being picky though - thoughts?

Holy shit a actual ban on this sub xD i thought that would be impossible but this guy did it. allahusnackbars for everyone!
Honestly, this is a gift to Russia. I have no idea why they kept forcing ceasefires when they expended a lot of effort on helping the SAA into an advantageous position. The meagre diplomatic points this scored cannot possibly be worth allowing the rebels to be resupplied and to reorganize themselves when they are on the ropes. If the US suspend the talks, the Russians can't do the same thing again, even though they probably would have signed another ceasefire soon. Now I don't want anyone to misunderstand me, of course this war needs to come to an end and a political solution would be for the best. However, the ceasefire attempts so far were doomed to fail, at least in the north and around Damascus, and ultimately probably just prolonged the war (I'm mainly talking about the February ceasefire, the last attempt didn't even take off at all and was so short it probably hardly impacted the position on the ground). A separate settlement in the south of Syria may be possible since the February ceasefire actually held there for quite a long time.

"There are some days when my dog shits pretty soft; however, I'd say that the vast majority of the time, my dog's shit is actually relatively hard. Like, if he only semi-poops, then the shit is ALL hard, but then if he goes again because he just didn't get it all out the first time, I'd describe the second shit as ""soft-serve"" but also mixed with some hard. Generally, though, I don't have a hard time bagging the dog shit after a walk. I'd attribute my dog's fecal matter hardness largely to the kind of food that I give him. It's very important--because my dog has a lot of skin issues and because I want him to live as long as possible--that I feed him no grain food, which is low on fillers like oats, wheat, etc. Those things might make other dogs' stool pretty soft, though I have not done a thorough independent study on this. It's the eyeball test from all the years I worked for a veterinary kennel. What I'm trying to say is that perhaps dog shit isn't the perfect analogy for the softness of r/nfl. I'm not terribly familiar with other kinds of animals' shit, though I'm not obstinately opposed. Perhaps you could use pig shit instead, as pigs often eat whatever you feed them and I would guess is also covered in shit, since pig slop is generally brown in color and pig sties are known for being unclean. Cat shit is another option, though I wouldn't call it as much soft as I would say it's smelly. I lived with a cat for a year, and WHOO BOY, that just wasn't my cup of tea. My dog would eat the cat shit all the time out of the litter box, and I just hope to God that it wasn't soft. I never really measured how soft his shit was after he ate the cat shit, but I have to imagine it was softer in consistency than his normal, everyday hard shit. Anyway, good luck to you. Enjoy your almost certainly deserved down votes, and I hope that no one ever head hunts you and then tells your friends and family what soft weenies they are being by using a poor analogy."

"Hillary Clinton would not have saved this planet. On climate change there's no doubt that she was better than Trump but she also failed to grasp the urgency of the issue. She considered it something worthy of *initiatives* while working to expand the global-scale industry that is doing the most damage. She took a ""common sense"" approach to energy reform while receiving millions from fossil fuel and hiring oil lobbyists to staff her white house. The **only** hope for the future is for every single person to look at every election as a vote for the candidate with the best climate change policy. In the case of the 2016 presidential election, she wasn't named Hillary."
Climate change won't affect us for another thousand years. There's bigger things to worry about like the rising amount of atheists in the world
It's more reasonable to argue that Clinton lost because she didn't make the economy her centerpiece.

In short, happy. Everything from the point where Anakin chops Mace Windu's hands off forward would have been different. If he hadn't fallen, he would have either killed Palpatine when he had the chance or arrested him and had him put on trial. The clone wars probably would have gone on for a while longer because there would have been nobody to tell where the Separatist leaders were hiding. The galaxy may have been split in two and a permanent rift might have been formed between two governments. Anakin would have probably been present at Luke and Leia's birth. Padme would have lived. Maybe he would have left the Jedi, maybe he wouldn't have, but everyone would be alive and their family would be intact. The Empire would have never come into existence and the Galactic Civil War wouldn't have happened. The galaxy would have been a much happier place...

It seems like with all the wikileaks, we have a weird dynamic where Hillary is having to defend her campaign staff more than the campaign has to defend her. Her people are very protective of her (probably due to all the criticism she's faced for decades), but they are not as disciplined and composed as she is. They can sound like assholes when bitching privately to each other about mundane things. On the other hand, Trump is the complete opposite. Raging asshole in private and public and his surrogates are constantly out there trying to polish the turds he lays on a daily basis.

SMOKING GUN: The mods are embedding secret visual messages in our header graphics. They've sold us out and are now working directly with the Ruskies. Here's proof.
Trump will win Michigan! Looking @ Emerson Poll Internals...
Obama is saying we don't act on leaked information. Not that we don't take issue with those that leak.
I'm not rich so if the fees are too high I won't get it. People with more resources than me should also put in a request.
"The Pulse Opinion Research survey found that 51 percent of Hispanics believe that there has been ""too little"" done to enforce immigration laws. What's more, by a margin of 49 percent to 36 percent, Hispanics ""support a policy causing illegal immigrants to return home by enforcing the law."""
So the media lied to us to get Hilary elected and then lied to us to get Trump elected?? I get that people are pissed, I am too, but you can't have it both ways...
I'm against illegal immigration. But what I don't get is why we focus on just the immigrants. I think we should be focusing on the businesses that employ them. If you make it impossible for them to work, that would do more to stem the tide than a wall would
Yeah, one of them has paid 100 billion dollars into the Social Security fund that they can never get back. One of them is also mostly Asians.
Fake SSN's are different from stolen SSN's. Fake means they aren't real.
What the fuck are ya on about? Hillary hasn't encouraged attacks on protesters, Hillary isn't planning to destroy relations with Mexico.
Just like Bannon and Breitbart give individual people a chance before making a blanket statement about their entire group.
There was never any credible doubt that Obama was born in the US though. We can't assume they're not eligible to run for president just because someone's parents aren't Wasps.
Short circuit? Now you aren't even making a coherent point.
If you see exactly the lay out of the protests, the bridge is the only way on-off the reservation. They are actually boxed in right now.
So you're agreeing with me...both parties have rights in a lease.

Flash S03E03 'Magenta' Live Episode Discussion Synopsis: Barry (Grant Gustin) and Team Flash are thrilled to reunite with Earth-2 Wells (Tom Cavanagh) and Jesse (guest star Violett Beane). Wells confides to Barry and Caitlin (Danielle Panabaker) that Jesse has all the powers of a speedster and has been saving people on his Earth. He is concerned about her safety and wants them to talk her out of using her powers. Meanwhile, Magenta, (guest star Joey King) a new meta who can control metal, terrorizes the city.

Hello everyone, I'm in Scotland and unfortunately had to go to bed last night so didn't see the game buy my god it sounds incredible.

Yes. This is worse. Those other posts are annoying but harmless. This is an example of criminal acts over a sport. Posting this is only likely to breed hate. It has no potential for any positive outcomes.
Lane Johnson's suspension has cost them. The right tackle that started today really struggled. To be fair, Kerrigan is a good pass rusher and Vitai (I think that's his name) will improve over the season, but I would expect us to cause problems for him next week. If we can keep Wentz under pressure then we should force them run on 3rd down like they did a lot today, and that means Linval eats. I also think we need to establish the run against them. Washington were gutting them on virtually every play, but Philly do have a strong secondary that will make it tough for us if we can't get yards on the ground. But overall I trust Zim to get us the W next week.
I do not know what you mean. Please go in depth

"Great article. I think they should pay taxes. Many of their for-profit businesses compete against my business directly. My own tithing is, in a sense, working against me. More than publishing their financials to appease the IRS, they should publish them for the members. For my grandmother who made nothing, but paid them everything. For my parents who cut back at Christmas to make sure ""God"" was paid first. For anyone who has sacrificed to make a tithing payment, the church should follow its own admonition and ""return, and report"" to each of us. If we are God's true church, then what are we ashamed of? What do we have to hide? Why so much secrecy? I still pay 10% tithing every year, but I don't pay it to the church anymore. I can report to God that my tithing actually makes it into the hands of the poor...those with whom Christ walked when He was alive."
I hate to think how much money we all spent as members of TSCC: temple clothes, garments, food storage, books, artwork, etc and in the end we either threw it away or gave it away. Made me a little sick, (actually a lot sick) even now when I come across something that I missed it irritates me.

How much of an impact will Derwin James have on the Clemson-FSU game if he returns? FSU's defense post-James has been abysmal, but steadily improving. They held Miami to less than 300 yards and dominated Wake. If James recovers in time for Oct. 29th, would that be enough to overthrow a turnover-ridden Clemson offense? If he doesn't return in time, do you think FSU has a chance? I'm just looking for some speculation of both scenarios to keep me occupied during the bye week for both teams

"Could I (21/F) use my mental disorder(s) to help me get my tubes tied faster? No one will tie my tubes because I'm too young. My gyn is super understanding but she's also not stupid. She told me point blank ""no one will do it this young."" And she's right. However I REALLY do NOT want a child from my body. Like I might end up killing myself that's how bad it is, or I would end up hurting us both. I don't EVER want to be pregnant for even a second, I would lose my mind. I don't want goo growing into something inside me ever! Also I have some mental disorders that are being tangled out and I'm trying a new med. My last med sent me to the ER. I cannot and WILL NOT be pregnant ever in my life. However miracles happen, I was one. And I can't afford to take the risk. How can I explain this in a way so that it might (if it even will) help me get my tubes tied? (Ps: I was so scared of being pregnant that I was determinately abstinant untill the end of last year. I probably still would be, but I kinda love my boyfriend.)"

Yeah but my point is why does it matter? They're eliminating their race by choice, so what's the big deal? If they were being genocided by China or something that's obviously a problem, but choosing not to bring more people into the world and sustain your race isn't really a bad thing. It's just a thing, not really positive or negative. Not like we can force them to make babies for their own supposed benefit. Essentially I'm questioning the ethics of not procreating for the good of your ethnicity. I don't see anything wrong with it personally.

Still, it felt like the only way to find someone interested in you. Are there any alternatives?

Tinder has always been full of fakes, but now I'm having to swipe through 20 or 30 profiles to find someone who isn't an obvious fake.

Homeless with pets and need some advice I'm not asking for money; I'm not sure that a little cash would solve most of my problems right now. My home burned about a month ago. I lost a couple pets, a few pets were rescued. I thought insurance was going to cover housing for the next several months, but they've changed their minds a couple days ago (and won't tell me why). Now I'm left without a home for the next several months. If it were just me that needed a home, that'd be bad enough. But my neighbor is (understandably) tired of watching my pets for the past several weeks. I would be heartbroken if I had to give up my animals. I don't know what to do. I live in the Phoenix, AZ area and I got some numbers from the Red Cross... I've called Social Serv and the Community Housing Partnership for the area; they didn't have anything for me, nevermind my pets. Same with Catholic Charities. The housing Authority of Maricopa County doesn't provide services for most of the metro Phoenix area. I tried calling the local homeless shelter, but they haven't answered the phone yet. I plan on going into the office if I can't get an answer but that's not easy; I don't even have a vehicle, or I could live in that for a while. I don't make a ton of money and having to pay the mortgage while the insurance company fixes up the house is a huge financial burden for me. I'll be devastated if I wind up on the streets (currently staying with someone, but I'm supposed to be out within the week) and it'll be even worse if I have to give up my pets (I've already lost 99% of everything I owned). Family in the area are no help and I have no friends nearby who can do anything. The local Community Action Network agencies have weirdly specific hours (one can't be called until next month, the other that MIGHT help can't be called until Thursday). I don't know what to do anymore. I can't even think about getting a better job until I have somewhere to live, but I can't afford the apartments that are available for myself (nevermind my pets) unless I have a better job. Have I missed something? What do I do?

"According to PFF, Billy Turner is only surpassed in ""worse"" by our own TJ Clemmings. BT is #75 to TJ's #76. That is ""overall"". As far as pass grade goes, BT is worse graded then TJ. Both have played the last 2 games as starting tackle. And it may not be a fluke. He was at the basement for grading in 2015 though I haven't seen the snap count."

Yup, it doesn't suit him and when ever he does it, you think of Triple H. For someone as talented as Rollins he should have his own finisher.
I only saw the CEO match, didn't know he was on UUDD.
Does anyone care? An honest question, do folk here actually care about Optic Halo? I got very interested in halo during the last chance qualifier, and obviously as an Optic fan from CoD my natural team is Optic. However its utterly depressing, its pretty clear even now they will once again finish bottom two, at the moment the team doesn't broadcast scrims but other pros do so you can watch from other teams point of view against us, we have lost every match I have seen, been smashed on more occasions than I care to think about. Why is this acceptable? Why is being 8th in the league acceptable for our organisation? If this was CoD this entire sub would be up in arms asking for better players, for something to be done, and lets not pretend that dropping str8sick was a good move. Its pretty apparent that Ace is good, other pros talk well about him but for whatever reason the teams not good enough, which will continue into this forthcoming season. So my question is to those that know more about Halo to me, what can be done about this, or why is nothing being done, is this the best we can get? So we just accept it?

There's a serious drawback to having a smooth crack - you can't sneak out the farts anymore. Even the small ones sound like a drum solo. And the big ones are just...there's no sound like them. If you're some sort of fart aficionado you might want to give it a try but if you're like most of us and want to keep them on the down-low in public, you're gonna want to keep that ass hairy. I think the hairs serve to cut through the bubble structure of the fart as it's escaping, so that instead of escaping as one big burst it comes out as a bunch of small jets.

Ryder Cup Weekend, weather and conditions High of 70 low of 55 for the next week, no rain. The course avoided the 8 inches of rain that fell last week and got about 2. The wind will be variable throughout the day but nothing too windy like last week 30mph all day. I expect low scores and very aggresive lines be taken.

Damn it. After the game Lavine just had Gary would've come in handy. Any word on if Jamal is starting? I'm kinda opposed to that and want my dream lineup of Mudiay-Chandler-Gallo-Jokic-Nurk but I'm pretty sure Jameer will start if not Murray
These under appreciated/ignored threads everyday are getting pretty old. In an age where you can tailor your news directly for you, there's no reason to complain about the lack of national media coverage. It's a 1-2 team that hasn't done anything in the playoffs for 8 years.
Murray is for sure going to score his first bucket tonight right guys? ... pls
what an enjoyable season this is going to be...
UFC 205 and Catan? If you like both of these, you should come over on Saturday. I live by red rocks community college and we would love to have some company. Message me if you're interested.
Huh, didn't realize Alonzo Gee was on the Nuggets now
Quite the elite rebounders we have on this team.
Haha... I wasn't referring to turkey day... At the end of the video, he states he won't be making any videos until the Houston game as he is taking a holiday. :D
I think I might start a YouTube channel this weekend. I'm going to test out some of my equipment from school and see if it still functions. I picked up a tripod and headset today during black Friday so wish me luck!
As long as Jameer is traded I'll be happy.
It is *the best* video game. Or, personal candidate thereof, rather.
Amazing. I was pretty stoked with 300!

Legitimately one of the best passes I've ever seen. Easily one of the best from a C.
Kenneth Faried is the only player still on the team from the Melo days right?
Gary Harris is my man crush
Played mostly **Rise of the Tomb Raider** and **Burnout Paradise** this past weekend. Tomb Raider is great, gonna sink a lot of time into that this week as well. Burnout is free on GWG and backwards compatible. Loads of fun. But playing it I remember that I enjoyed Burnout 3 a little more than Paradise. As for content, obviously the 2 Mario Party Parties last week. Neither was really any good but isn't that the point? My favorite part is how I was sorta dozing off near the end of MPP 9 and then Jeff randomly screamed at the Wiggler and I woke up. Good times.
this game could use more ally sturm
I just checked and they dont even follow eachother on twitter
I honestly don't bother posting a lot of articles about GSM-inclusive games here because I know they'll be downvoted into oblivion, and it saddens me.

"Wow, you're literally the first person I've ""heard"" say this. Seems like people either are in AnimZero's place or in mine, where I had really good insurance at high but stable price and now pay more but have a far worse plan. I'm glad it worked for you, but I'm looking forward to changes."
Well, here's hoping! I thoroughly enjoyed that episode and got a bunch of people into the podcast through it.
Is Kenneth Faried wasting his prime with the Nuggets?
So im halfway into my 4th day of heavy holiday boozing. Is cheerleader dancing weird to anyone else?
meh you're probably right we'd never win a good pick anyway
He didn't go to San Franciso when Vinny and Alex went. It may have had something do with the death in his family recently.
I didn't know you guys had so many second rounders. Dang. I'll trade you Rozier for Murray straight up though ;)
And Sean Murray also straight up lied about several things in the game. I mean yeah, the responses aren't particularly kind, but... don't lie to people?

Denver Nuggets Complete 2016-17 NBA Season Preview
I found it weird that Juancho wasn't in the 1st round pickups section. But that's more an omission than something I disagree with. Jamal Murray being considered a pg more than a sg was weird. I know he says he's a Point Guard, but he's almost definitely going to get his minutes in at the 2. Also 40-42 record... but 5th in the Northwest? Really? Talk about a million dollar move with a 10c finish.

Hopefully they bring a better card next time ... ?? orr.... at least put Doo Ho Choi on it!
Blackhawks fans..... don't get me started.
I'm still a fan of getting rid of Karl. Just like with Melo it was success sure but a first round exit every year. Not to mention he couldn't draw up an inbounds play to save his life...
I'm at work, but could pop in the radio, what station is it on?
As good as the Nuggets have looked the Mavs are really not playing well.
Nuggets fans, how is you shooting guard battle likely to go down? Murray is a prize, way more people should know who Malik Beasely is, and Gary Harris has talent but has been slow to take a step. What gives? I think in general your team looks very much in the position to trade
Titanfall 2 has mechs. Battlefield 1 does not.
I bought that Humble Gem Bundle and have played a surprising amount of Chroma Squad. It's a simple little Tactical Super Sentai/Power Rangers game and I'm just all the way into it. It's bringing back a lot of really fond memories watching the original Power Rangers when I was a kid. So my squad, named the Charge Deputies, is kicking monster ass and taking monster names. This weekend I'm being an adult and voting, getting a haircut, and finally putting a duvet on our bed.

It's very true. Lifelong resident of Spokane (south hill mostly) until 2009. We would wait WEEKS before our neighborhood we be plowed after a big snowfall. Then spend days trying to clear out our driveway from the plow berm. I live in Missoula now and shits cleared within 2 days max! Plows and de-icing happens early and often. It's crazy how efficient this town gets it handled compared to Spokane. Know what else? Our potholes get fixed pretty quickly too!

The cost of this will be a big decider for me. Right now I pay $50 a month for Foxtel, but that gives me far more benefits than *just* F1, as it gets a huge variety of sports and basically every motorsport. For just F1 i'd struggle to justify more than say, $10 a month.

Why do your German ships have a Swastika on the flags behind them lol?
How on earth he did that, I've got no fucking idea.
Senna's hand came out of the sky to spin the car back around. Only explanation.
Would have been awesome, but it might have taken away some of it. If all Rosberg had to do was finish on the podium, as soon as the Red Bulls had to go back to wets, the championship would have been decided. Max's drive would have been amazing either way, but at least there's still some suspense for the championship. This race would not have been particularly exciting championship-wise.
Turns out when you make BBs nearly invulnerable to torps and heavily incentivize them to get closer to the enemy due to awesome secondaries then yeah, these things will happen. Now whether hydro on BBs is a good thing or not in general is another question (my opinion it should never be put on any BB besides the Germans) but it led to more pushing German BBs for sure.
I know this, however, I ask for a reason. If DDs are experiencing the issue as outlined by Iku, but the other ships are not, then this is potentially a much larger issue. However, if the other ship lines have a similar inconsistency, and there are numbers to back it up, then you have to wonder if this is one of the ways ships are balanced against each other. That's why I was wondering if cruisers and battleships have similar inconsistencies.
Sounds like a bug. I don't have Perth and can't confirm, but that really sounds like an oversight. Nobody tested Spotter II because nobody uses premium catapult planes.
Sony users have had waterproofing for like the past 4 years. Motorola has made waterproof phones too.
I gues Kuma. I used to enjoy the Aoba a lot before ovepens and angling as a thing. Not sure how she is now. I enjoyed most IJn cruisers tbh. Myoko, Mogamy &amp; Takao class are all sollid ships. Keep those you enjoy. Personaly i often sells ships i am past. I play the IJn tree as one of the trees that i have no real goal for. Sure Ibuki and Zao are great but i could not care too much about them. Not in the same way i want Yamato, Bismarck, Warspite, Scharnhorst etc. Keep those that you feel like keeping tbh. Not much else reasoning needed.
Even that is... Uh...
Firing at anything over 12k away in the Gneisu is more like a courtesy... like you feel obligated to do so with ZERO expectations.
Here's hoping it becomes like Lauda and Hunt when they're both retired. It also seems like we just rarely see the moments when they're actually friendly - the TV cameras capture only the moments immediately after the race. For example, I recall Will Buxton mentioning that in Austin last year, they were drinking and laughing together later in the night after Hamilton had beaten Rosberg to the title and hat-throw-gate.
So keep your reserves full!
They seem to earn you a pin, and then you're done with it. Having earned five pins, you can unlock a final task, which is: Do all the tasks! I'm even serious. Of course, I am not against more missions and challenges, it's just that I want the limited time I have to play WoWS focused on actually playing the game, not administering it. It's not *World of Accountants*...
Joyful and triumphant
It says Santa Monica BMW though? Or do you mean there was a similar campaign in the UK?
I see where you're coming from but I love the RN CLs, most fun I've had in WoWs for months. But I agree I hope they don't try and do something silly for the BB and DD lines. Also they need to rush the damn DD line so we can get the Haida as a premium.

The thing is, even with the higher peak power output and improved fuel efficiency of the Honda PU, McLaren were still behind Scuderia Toro Rosso in places where the chassis mattered. Sure, the Honda PU wasn't great, but neither was their chassis.

That social ranking shit they are implementing in China. I have a FB and I have a linkedin. I hate having to keep up with Jones on FB. Imagine having that affect your credit score, where you can live, who you can interact. A Matter of fact, LinkedIn already affects where you can work. It is your resume for all to see. Its odd these days not to have an account when you work whitecollar. Black mirror did an episode on this but China is really implementing this social ranking bs.
This was clearly planned..
But its still smol
Yeah, I think that's what's going to stop me from buying these. Have seen a bunch of photos of reviewers with them and man do they look geeky. I wonder if they did another color if they would look better.
Haha I know right! But if people come to bother us when we play, that means they think we're so good at what we're doing so talking to us wouldn't bother us, which is nice I guess :p

Disturbing implications from Micheal post-scoop -Every single person he interacted with do not know he's dead. Every handshakes, talk, afternoon football game, and every family photo, and he's a dead man in the same room as them. -After a few days/weeks, a corpse eventually looses all control of there bowels. All of that rotten mucus-caked crap and partly-digested popcorn is just going to fall out one day. -He would have to live a decent lonley life for someone not to be detected by people as a robot. -All the eyes of Funtime Freddy, Foxy, Bidybabs, etc would be tucked under the skin would just see blackness and feel the churning of rotten insides. -We have to come to the sad realization that, at one point, his penis rotted off. Hell, it could be laying around somewhere. -When the staff of CBeaR come back they will see a pile of broken bones and pulp and have no explanation of it. -Claustrophobic? Imagine sharing a body with 10 people. That's what Baby feels now forever. -Ennard is in the sewer, right? Well he has only 2 options for reurfacing, a manhole or your toilet. -Think your corpse body is disgusting? Too bad it's how you are forever now that you can't die.

(Sorry if these get too spammy) I remade my original Nightmare Funtime Freddy, and while I made big improvements on the overall thing, I really like the Bonnie Puppet/Freddle thing.

My friend, you need to submit this to the contest.
"The Church of Chud: That Squirrel Has Been In The End Zone More Than Green Bay Edition Brothers. Sisters. Praisers of Squirrels. We gather again in the humbling halls of the Church of Chud for joyous reason. Victory. And not just a victory, but one against a top tier organization in the Packers of Green Bay. Praise be! First 5 and last 5 were in full effect and Jordan Todman's 99 yard touchdown on the initial kickoff was what jumpstarted Head Monk Pagano's latest mantra. Todman did not stop there though, for he returned his second kick for 61 yards and that led to the Elder Vinatieri to extend his consecutive made field goal record extend by one. Praise be to good special teams all around! Praise be to the nearded King Luck. Quick releases. Avoiding sacks. Running well and sliding under big hits. 281 yards passing and a touchdown to MasterCrief. He was even blessed enough to let Ha Ha Clinton-Dix catch two passes, so that he could be nice to a man with such a funny name. 9 men in blue were lucky enough to catch a pass from the holy one on this day. Praise be to Luck. Praise be to what I'm being told is called ""Pass Rush"". I'm vaguely familiar with the term, but it seems like years since I've heard it used in a positive sense. Apparently the front 7 were getting something called ""pressure"" on Aaron Rodgers and even sacked him 3 times. Granted, they gave him a lot of time in the pocket some plays, but on others they were all over him. All-in-all, they had a pretty good day. Praise be to the pass rush! Praise be to Darius Butler who had a sick as hell pick on A-Rodg after the stripes took away the great pick by the alter boy TJ Green the play before. You know what? Praise be to the entire defense this week. They showed up in the big spots against an elite offense. Go Defense Go. Finally, let us praise the reason we are here. 1 year ago in Week 9 of 2015, Rob Chudzinski took over the offense as coordinator from the cancerous Pep Hamilton. For his anniversary he came out and called a very good game. Blocking had issues at times and great defensive schemes by Green Bay killed some well set up plays before they had a chance to get going. He stayed aggressive all the up to the end of the game and made a gutsy late game call to throw deep on 3rd and short that ultimately sealed the game. No one understood the first 5, last five mantra as much as our man Chud. PRAISE BE TO CHUD! We will take next week off as the team does as well. Until then, stay faithful. This season is far from over and 3 teams made the playoffs with a 3-5 record last year (Houston, Washington, and Kansas City). I believe in blue and I hope you do too. I mean, the Cubs just won the World Series so crazier things have happened in sports this year than us hoisting the Lombardi trophy. Praise be!"
Who do you think deserves comeback player of the year this season? I had a talk with my buddy about this and I was curious about who you guys think should get it.
Irsay SHOULD make him an offer he can't refuse.
I got to go on the field yesterday during warmups. I took this video that sums up how I left the stadium after the beatdown.
I feel like Peyton would hate being an OC. Only cause he's so good. I'd imagine him getting mad at every QB for not seeing what he sees. He saw everything on the field too, so imagine how much he can see when not actually in the game.
Dalvin Cook announces he will declare for the 2017 NFL Draft.
Sankey is worse than everyone on our roster and Evans is over the hill.

Chargers have #1 overall offense.
I hope they both lose.
So about being scared of the Texans... 0-10 at halftime
This is the week when we have our team healthy?????
Looking at total yards, points, points/yard per drive and DVOA etc Seattle was still the 2nd or *maybe* 3rd best defense last season. And looking at those same stats they are still in that 1-3 range this season. Right now they aren't historically dominant like they were in 2013 but they are still up there as an elite defense. It's just not as exciting as the Vikings/Broncos/Eagles rise
Can anybody recommend an app just to check box scores?

soooooo, you guys think Marcus Smart will be droppable in 12-team once Crowder and Horford come back?
"Happy 'Lonely' Thanksgiving Happy Thanksgiving Ex Jw's!!!! It will be a lonely one for me, since my mother insists it is evil even though it has no true pagan ties. Days like this remind of how delusional witnesses are. As I seen somewhere else on this sub, my other family, friends, and coworkers are so happy this time of year and granted they should be like that all the time (supposedly like the witnesses) when the holidays come about everyone is just in better spirits because of being off work, big sales events, spending time with family, and eating delicious food. It really reminds me of how lonely it made me feel growing up as a JW. Seeing everyone else enjoy themselves and having to remember that they're giving into their selfish sinful desires by celebrating, but how since we have the truth we'll have the last laugh in the paradise lmao. Just even thinking about it now makes me laugh. What a load of crock shit. It is simply amazing how many of us were brainwashed to believe that we must ""keep our eyes on the prize"" and ""not lose sight"" by watching everyone else rejoice but we have to go in service or go to the meetings and pretend that others aren't having the time of their lives. I missed out on so much growing up. I still miss out now, since my family doesn't celebrate. It kinda makes me want to have my own big family so we can celebrate as we please. Needless to say, I am thankful this year that even after 5 years of being inactive, I woke up this year to the horrible truth that is ""the truth"" about the truth. I am thankful for waking up, my job, my family (even though my mother still is inclined not to talk to me), my friends, and my health. What are YOU thankful for? Happy thanksgiving all!"

My boi Nic Batum with the bomb ass first half
In the end he didn't even do the proper seal. He ended with the tiger seal.
I have season tickets haha! But it is a big game and I don't want to miss it. I have been trying to convince her just to go to the game with me and I will buy her a ticket.
Everyone hating on the Dolphins D is going to be pleasantly surprised this year. Losing Brent Grimes was the best thing to ever happen to our unit.
Well I can't say anything about the album crashing, the reason it goes back to the top when you exit the app is because you're hitting the back button which closes the app. Bacon reader does not store location data when you close it so it doesn't remember where you were when you reopen it. if you just close it by hitting your home button that won't be a problem

I'd like him on my team love the dude, but I was scared to take him in early 4th as WR 1
Every single Episode?
What's something that is surprisingly less than 100 years old?
The Sunday night football song is catchy.
Points for passing I would think. WR's still get points on trick plays where they throw the ball.
Luis Scola can score from anywhere!
You're welcome to your opinion, but Romo generally torches the Giants when they play them. I mean, you could want to play Lebron James instead of Brian Scalabrine, but it doesn't mean that's the best choice.
Redskins TE Jordan Reed has been officially diagnosed with a concussion. Jay Gruden says he's in the protocol.
So then the Bible says abortions are okay!
Wait so Danielle said she's not using it on Scott?
Big Brother Over the Top - Wednesday Night Live Event Discussion - November 02 2016 On the live feeds tonight, beginning at 10p EDT/7p PDT, we will have a one hour recap of the past week. At 11p EDT/10p PDT, We will have a live eviction. If it's anything like last week, it will be very productionless and the HG will fill in for most of Julie's usual role. Starting at midnight/ 9pPDT, an HOH competition will be played. During the eviction, your best bet is to watch the Quad View. Who will be evicted? How will the votes fall? What awkward moment will we get from the live eviction? How about the weird 30 min of nothing after that and before HOH? Who will be crowned? Discuss all that and whatever else below.
Keep seeing people say whitney has no shot at winning but i mean lots of game is left! She's a dark horse :) I would prefer her over Justin and Kryssie winning
So who is going up???? They are talking about pawns????
Bless us. What did we ever do to deserve Shelby?
I wouldn't be taking this NEARLY as good as she is right now. I'd be hitting shit

for real doe, any info on when NNYs that were ordered in mid to late September are at. I miss the order numbers so I'd know when numbers near me had come in.
Ok, Which One Of You......?
Yet another Scannable NNY question... If i send my real u21 photo from my NNY id to scanny would that possible to have put on the id? with the grey back drop.Thanks
what about 5600?
What's with all the caps
Noob question - can you sell a real CA id Ive gotten a couple of id's on here (s/o evolved for taking my virginity) but since I'm finally 21 this month my CA id is about to expire I've already gotten my new one from the dmv for my 21st so I'm all set. My question is, is there a market for selling your old one? The expiration date is for the end of the month but would someone be able to use it to get into clubs or bars even if its expired? Or could i sell it if someone needed a physical to duplicate?
sounds about right, I'm probably going to do about 10 or so
When I go to submit a resell order for Scanny and see NNYs are up to $120
If she can't spot a fake with a jewelers loupe then she must be at least a little inbred.
uhm ya if it was $75 I wouldn't care
I thought you were on break tho
Calling out Planet fakes
I'm willing to send you a picture of it just for proof, no charge or anything, let me know if you want it scanny.
What I think of when Scannable makes excuses about poor cs and slow shipping
Absolute savage
Jesus Christ all these VA reviews where are all the WI's at?
Scanny. But SPB did say he'd give you a discount so that's a stroooong contender. Don't even consider a god
ever gotten a person who switched their shipping address and their fake address? Puts real address to be put on fake and fake address in shipping.
Not going to argue with your spastic ass, you think of yourself way too highly and need a reality check asap.
So if someone with the same name as you owed someone else $1000 you also owe them $1000?
Not for comments
I didn't hate it. I thought having CJ be fat as fuck to be entertaining.
Found this historical parody meme and thought you guys would get a kick out of it!
Marco's pissed again.

Let see here: * Counting false reports * Punishing innocent player, repeatedly * Forcing player to smurf in order to avoid further LPQ * Ruin lower skill matches because of smurfing I see nothing wrong here
I really wish they'd at least partially resurrect Morrowind's directional attack system, in that the direction you're pressing on the control stick matters in terms of the direction of your swing. Side to side results in a lateral slash, standing or diagonal movement is a vertical chop, and in-line movement makes you thrust. This would add more variety to animations, increase available combat strategies, and allow for different weapon types to exist like rapiers or spears (which own the thrust but pretty much can't cut at all).
I got a daedric warhammer at lvl 32. Was shocked as I didn't expect it at all. Luckily my character at the time was a 2h Warrior so it worked out well :)
Oh the horror!!
I say that while I'm in the middle of an argument about whether Hunger Games ripped off Battle Royale with a person that's never seen Battle Royale. I also don't care about Hunger Games and haven't seen Battle Royale since at least 2005. I ended up in this mess because I clicked on a thread about Divergent, a movie *I've* never seen. fucking. reddit.

HOLY SHIT EPIC TWITTER MELTDOWN
Nah, he's a useful idiot. A puppet, if you will.
Anon realizes how uninformed he is.
do liberals think we need a 'first' whenever possible and not the 'best'?
Let's see, there's donnie's sub, Hillary for prison, and now I can't even go to still Sanders because that's been taken over by lunatics and mods who inject their personal shitty opinions at the top of each comments page, knowing that they can stay on top of others. I had to leave.
That's a pretty broad generalization of people. There are plenty of Trump supporters who don't feel this way, and don't act this way at all. It's divisive comments like this that pull us all farther apart.
"Binas costume this year a ""Beanie baby"""
It's amazing a superior intellect like his can be so thoroughly triggered by feminists and social justice warriors (SPOOKY).
So I'm going to be alone forever? This is why I'm murderous, is because I'm alone. I idolize people like Elliot Roger and stuff, because they were all isolated. If I wasn't so isolated, I wouldn't be filled with murderous rage.
What would you do with a prostate?
Before making the photo larger, I thought that was an easy bake oven.
"I promise, I'm being serious. Can you give an example? I feel like I have only ever encountered the kind who freaked out over ""you people."" As in ""you people over there."" Like a group of random people standing on the other side of the room."
What's an engagement ring's future? I always wondered. What do you do with it after you married and started wearing the wedding ring? Do you still put it on?
You're able to set up your Google account in such a way that it sends trusted contacts your info, or it deletes your account and everything for you after an alloted amount of inactivity. I think it's called Inactive Account Manager. I've yet to set anything up like that because a part of being in your twenties is a hubris like sense of invincibility. If I were to die tomorrow I'd be straight fucked.
What are your thoughts on Trump's new policy proposal to give 6 weeks paid maternity leave to all new mothers?

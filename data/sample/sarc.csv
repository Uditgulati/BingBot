Last Friday was good (thanks Comey and Chaffetz) but we need something fresh to dominate the news cycle over the weekend. A Monday bombshell might do something to effect Hillary turnout but probably won't make anyone pick Trump instead just because of how long it takes normies to digest the information (and because MSM just won't cover it). Dump tomorrow and give it time to sink in and let Wiki come in with a turnout killshot on Monday. Please Kek!

His wife was illegal when she was doing porn in New York."" Me: ""Where's the proof?"" Family: ""What?"" Me: ""Where's the proof that she was illegal in New York? Show me."" Family: ""Well... Trump says lots of stuff without proof."" Me: ""So you have no proof?"" Family: ""Who cares? Trump is going to start WWIII."" Me: ""Actually, Hillary has more of a reputation of being a war hawk and uses way more warlike language than Trump does. Trump wants peace more than anything. If anyone would start WWIII, it'd be Clinton with how much she is blaming Russia for everything. Plus, Hillary Clinton broke the law multiple times and was directly responsible for the death of Americans."" Family: ""Trump's broken laws, too."" Me: ""What laws?"" Family: ""His tax returns. You really think he got all that money legally?"" Me: ""He's run hundreds of hugely successful businesses and doesn't have a pattern of having people close by him die suddenly."" Family: ""You know Trump's killed people."" Me: ""Where's the proof?"" Family: ""Come on, you know he did."" These are my struggles. This is the ecosystem of a centipede in California...."
0	Say you are part Native American and call them all racist and bigots	N9neRhymes	The_Donald	3	3	0	2016-09	1473294438	"What should I do about my current class situation where I am being attacking by literally everyone for supporting Donald Trump. My new semester just started a few weeks ago and the first day of class it was beyond obvious that my professor was a die hard Clinton supporter. On top of that he uses every example possible during his lectures to make Clinton look like the savior of the U.S while turning Trump in to the devil. Not to mention all the students are sheep. Today though specifically I felt like I was being singled out for my support of Donald Trump, which was only made obvious because my professor said something about how Donald Trump is a bad man and I replied with ""How is Trump considered bad compared to clinton."" That is when the entire class laughed and I could here mumbling of ""ohhh here we go."" So at this point I feel like I am being singled out and harassed by not only the professor for looking at me every time he gives some stupid clinton/trump example where she always comes off as the lord and savior of our country but also by the students themselves. I say the students to because I was pretty much baited/verbally attacked by a muslim student who was making some kind of example and in it the student said that ""Donald Trump wants to ban all Muslims from coming in to the U.S and all the ones currently here which includes me."" This is when the professor looked over at me as if I was the terrible being for supporting such a hateful person. This is also when I stuck up for my self and Trump and proceeded to speak on trumps immigration policy and vetting process for future Muslims wanting to come to America that are coming from conflict areas or suspected areas. Honestly I may be over thinking all of this but it does feel like I am almost being targeted in this class for who I support and my only reason for ever and telling them who I support was because the professor is saying that trump is a bad man. edit1:probably a lot of grammar mistakes I am typing this 3 minutes before my next class. I will fix them later."

That is a mutual decision though. I come on this sub and all I feel is positivity. I don't even go to the reddit home page anymore. I come here. I have been coming here for a long time. Everyone is so nice to one another. All we want is a beautiful, well run country. God, I love Donald Trump so fucking much. He's going to save us and most people don't even fucking appreciate it. I literally weep when I watch any Trump videos. Tears of joy. This sub is basically what my life is when I'm not working has become. I love all you motherfuckers, and we are going to win this. There is no alternative. You god damn motherfuckers, you've gotten to my heart, which isn't easy to do. We are going to save this god damn country. And we are going to make America great again.

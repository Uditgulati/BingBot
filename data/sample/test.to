#WHY AM I NOT 50 POINTS AHEAD
A Lizard Person
We are going to landsline Ohio and Michigan
I lost as soon as I read the title
But Trump won Michigan and Wisconsin lol
It's time to get schwifty in here

But his ideal position would be one bent over the table with a cigar in hand!
It's like I always say man, speak softly, but carry a big there's no problem down their folks, believe me
Pe_oe
5 Layers of Spice
Obama skipped everything day
The Cigar
Let me know their reaction when Trump hits them with absolutely flawless Tax Returns.
Say you are part Native American and call them all racist and bigots
The Obama administration is a huge fan of allowing Terrorist nations to obtain nuclear power.
Make Raw-Doggin' It Great Again!
Freedom boners last anywhere between 4-8 years.
Paul Ryan's biography?
He's not a part of the Political System that has been fucking our shit up for the past 3 decades.
The American people will take notice of this.
#WE ARE THE MEDIA NOW
It's obviously cucked it's fucking name is Big Black Cock
Wait until our God Emperor is elected, you'll have a much easier time finding your ideal match after that ;) Anyone female crying about a President Trump will officially be on the 'Untouchable' list
California is going Red baby!
(I'm wearing my SECOND pair of pistols atm lol, I can't help myself)
Plz send me all the shoes u don't want to look at, thanks.
I think OTK is more current right now, but will prolly get dated quicker?
But like, not that actual spot because the hill to get in was super duper brutal.
Then deff don't take it to the dealership, take it to a smaller mechanicl
"lmao same like ""let me flash you my lower thigh!"""
"o shit that just made me realize another convo I don't want to have... ""whyyyyyy aren't you getting married in a lutheran church?????"""
...this isn't even all of it, lol.
oh man my very first wedding nightmare involved the makeup people taking SO LONG to put on my foundation that they didn't have time to even do any other makeup and I don't even like foundation... BRAIN WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO ME SHTAPPPPP
So good.
They really need to check behind that shower curtain...
And then there were three.
I'd still prefer them over a haunted house
I made it forty one seconds in before I turned it off after he said that Trump has to connect with me due to being a man.
Putting serious thought into selling my Journey into Mystery: Complete Collection trades for that omnibus.
Hooray for more pollution, I guess.
So which Gwen variant is going to get an ongoing series this time?
If you have to ask, you are not an alpha.
"""OR ARE YOU?!?"""
It's perfect, given his experience in teaching science to children.
Because it's being held up by four elephants standing on the back of a turtle, obviously.
No, it has not been confirmed.
And nothing of value was lost.
They aren't committing genocide, nor are they invading their neighboring countries.
"My favorite is ""When you're gone, I'll go mad^1"" 1) He did."
Is it really too much to ask to have the O5 sent back to the past?
Dexter
What?
It's really weird that they actually have a fan made poster as the official one.
So being a skeptic means we should all believe a nonsensical conspiracy theory with no real supporting evidence?
"The standard answer is ""Marvel characters are men trying to be gods, while DC characters are gods trying to be men."""
Stilt Man
The amount of cognitive dissonance in you is staggering.
I always make that mistake...
It can definitely be creepy, depending on the age gap, but I don't think it's unethical at that point.
Given Trump's position on torturing suspected terrorists and killing their families, this isn't surprising.
Or, they could end up doing quite well in the future, depending on the outcome of the election.
The Mercedes commercial is the new intro.
"I've described this comic to friends as ""a really great spy comic before everything turned into mushrooms."""
Look around, look around at how lucky we are to be alive right now.
Well I have Bojack Horseman, so...
I think it went back and forth for awhile, but at this point if I had to make a guess I would say that Trump's poll numbers are at a point where he can not recover in time for November 8, leading to Clinton taking the presidency.
This fucking election cycle...
Do you honestly think people need to be paid to mock Trump?
Headline coming soon: James O'Keefe's lawsuit thrown out of court due to lack of evidence.
"""All polls are biased unless they show the results I want to see."""
Giuliani has a women in prison fetish, apparently.
Yes
If we can cancel it and start over with new primaries and better candidates, then sure.
Worst case scenario is that the Battery are going to be really really good next year.
I won't
Atlanta is still #1 in Allocation Order
That's the beauty of it...You don't have to understand
Effort
I don't disagree considering Seattle was the last expansion side to do so.
That would be fun, because it would force others to keep up as well.
I wonder if this was Minnesota's plan all along.
All that is left is determining who is the new Pepe Pinton that will hold the brand hostage for 20 yrs.
Tambakis is American, Burgous has a green card
RSL needs to get younger
It is looking like USL was superior...not trying to start anything but one is dying and one isn't.
Yep Orlando is gonna get paid
Less risky with USL Productions
North Carolina or Nashville
Well Chicago NASL sounds like fan fiction at this point, which may be the bigger problem in this deal anyway.
The fact that you used the word fairly...makes me doubt that he is gone at all.
That stadium was in Ft Lauderdale...The point of the this Miami team is Miami proper, but it is difficult.
That's Parkhurst...Leader in the clubhouse to be captain.
Wouldn't shock me at all.
For the last week we have been saying that.
We will see won't we.
Possibly Traffic...Railhawks just applied for a new mark likely due to Traffic still owning theirs.
I am denying interest in Scarlet Johanssen
Yes neutrals will watch something like that.
Hat Trick today for likely #1 pick vs The Netherlands in the U20 Four Nations Cup.
They aren't going to keep them out of the playoffs.
442 writer
Oh I get it, you are in rant mode.
That sounds like a tomorrow alke-holic problem.
I want to get of Zimmers wild ride.
"""You'll learn to live in the better world under President Trump, don't fret girl..."" Dude (and I'm going to assume you're definitely a dude) fuck off back to your crawl space."
"May I also say ""extremely careless?"""
It'll go well with her water that was used to defros-I mean chicken sauce!
No force game chat :/
There's no point, I hate the mindset of everything has to be on equal ground (looking at you BO3), it feels good playing well with a crappy gun.
I have a time machine, they're telling 100% truth we time travelers don't lie.
I know, on recovery he used Kahlil a lot and all of his beats are trash to be honest, even I could make them in garage band.
IW uses the infinity ward engine, sledgehammer let Raven use the AW engine so that's why it was built on that one.
I only play SnD so I don't have to worry about spawns ever.
Damn someone salty, people have opinions, just let them have them.
"In 07 it was amazing, this game wasn't remastered to ""compete"" with the new games, it was put in to satisfy players who are getting bored of 3D movement."
You can tell this is a rookie montage, poor editing, no music, bad cuts with dead time between, not hating but you need to work on it a lot.

~~1,559,527~~ back (still on mobile, the run dream is over lmao) anyways its still pretty bad because first his body is gonna get fried due to lack of sleep and the 20 hour crash is not gonna make up, the damage is already done--also, it wouldnt even compare to the ~45-63 hours of sleep he just lost
1,559,529 i wonder how the sleep schedule started, if the tiredness from sleeping thing started after, it could be the body's response to no sleep--it cant even register sleep as being normal anymore
1,560,400
1,560,408. hmm, so i can get 4s on mobile

Pros and cons of living in Japan: Pros: * Anime * J-pop and J-rock * Hentai Cons: * Literally everything else
Unpopular opinion: I like FNAF
So can someone give me some context to this clown shit?
Not as painful as capitalism fucking you in the ass.
So you're not going to explain what the difference is.
"Fuck man, I know you didn't mean it that way, but seeing a sentence worded this way gives me flashbacks to all those shitty arguments with liberals saying things like ""Communism has never worked""."
"Yeah, I mostly meant ""Kanji sucks to learn"", but it's a necessary evil because holy shit it really does hurt to read texts without kanji."
Ouch
Also, they will probably hate you for advocating for an ideology that killed 600 billion people, so there's that...
Where does that happen and what excuse do they use?
Well, I didn't go to school in America, so it makes sense I would have never heard of TKaMB.
Because they aren't pulling themselves up by their bootstraps, duh
Yup that's where the name is from
More light in A, easier to see detial
Just treat him like a black guy in 1950s Alabama.
It is if you jerk off with death grip and/or can't separate reality from fantasy.
Gotta love DOOM yo.

Uh yeah.
30 openly bi and definitely a filthy pagan since I was 13.
I can't wait for this dude to get caught being a creep.
How is being willfully ignorant hot?
You aren't sexually conservative if you're a toxic self hating piece of shit no one wants.
Good start, now whip all your dicks out.
I feel like a bag of cocaine is needed in there somewhere too.
Seriously lol
Why you so jelly lol
Yeah and the power of friendship.
Can I get a quick summary or something the site won't load on mobile.
Your mobile doesn't have a camera?
So he can try to guilt him into a relationship and lose a friend in the process lol great advice!
Well this was a refreshing change of pace from what we usually see here.
It's the remix to ignition hot and fresh out the kitchen, mama rolling that body got every man in here wishing.
Tbf tho Stalin had a sick mustache.
Top, bottom or verse?
Lol ok
Somewhere Chris G and his pony tail are violently fapping to this.
Nice dick.
Donald Trump him and grab him by the boipussy.
Well thanks for that waste of time I guess.
I've seen your posts and you've been told countless times dick size isn't that serious, I'm not gonna entertain your bullshit here.
Reread your comments.
I'm not white or Muslim so what does any of this have to do with me or anything I've said?
Fingers, then a dick.
What like you've never slipped on a banana peel and ended up balls deep in a tight ass, don't be a jerk.
Sounds like he's just nice and you're reading way too into it cuz you have a crush.
Share with the class.
Agreed anything harder than coke or weed and it's 100% Bye Felicia and even those are ok only in moderation and used reasonably.
I know boo now lemme get that booty.
Also gravy OP is just high with a new fondue pot.

How'd I know all the comments were gonna be ppl whining about her smoking like anyone cares lol?
You can't suck his dick jackass, he's not gay or into you.

That's what he gets for not covering his mouth like a savage.
Grindr got you bro.
Lol the salt is real
U 2 bud.
Are you bi or talking like a gay guy randomly falling for a woman?
Always take mine off they just make it awkward to have to adjust them as I'm pounding ass.
Sacrifice a sock.
And?
And before that when he made the Destroyer Armor and still got whooped on.
You're half and half like creamer.
Why?
Cold beer, whiskey, art, live music, bubble butts, nice dicks, comics, museums, long walks at night, random bus rides with music blaring in my earbuds and no real destination.
Just be normal and keep doing what you're doing don't over think it and get all crazy like way too many gays do especially ones that post here.
The one time I go looking for spoilers and not a single one in sight...
That's cuz it's just bananas in a blender, nice shit post.
That's just called being bi.
It's okay he's lying anyways.
Eye contact is awesome for some stuff like bjs.
Stole a page from floridaman I see.

Probably projecting.
Dafuq did you just say brev?
Dat ass tho!
Soooooooo you trying to get that ass smash or nah?
So then you're ready for some BBC?
Ty for the well thought out/informative response!
Ok how about the level of desperation it takes to start looking at your own family as a dating pool rather than just going out and meeting a guy like a normal person should?
"No you're just an idiot ""I wanted to waste millions on a wall cuz it might look neat"", what are you 12?"
Not gonna lie, if you knew we were coming and flaked like that I'd ghost the shit outta you.
Then why stay?
That goddamn frog...
That depends on if you're hot or not really.
100 bucks she's overweight with a lazy eye and/or a fucked up grill.
Yup totally are.
The self deception is strong here.
It's in the advanced settings.
Yes, though not really recommened
If you got an Nvidia card, Moonlight and a smartphone.
Remove the GPU's heatsink shroud, stick the pads to the VRM's (and replace any thermal paste on the GPU), put heatsink back on, done
If you live near a microcenter, the 6600K regularly goes on sale for less than $200
It'll work, motherboards, no matter the brand or CPU they take, don't care what GPU goes in a PCIe slot.
Download the Linux version.
It's a pricing error
For ARMA 3, you need a better CPU.
Then yes you could have potentially fried your components since those bags can generate static electricity.
Out of stock it seems
Assuming it has Intel HD graphics, No.
1050Ti easily.
A CPU/RAM upgrade is strongly recommend.
Sorry dude but rule 8
Everything, show him the builds!
You'll need to upgrade the motherboard and RAM with that CPU.
Eh both your CPU and GPU are pretty weak, a whole system upgrade would be the best course of action.
You'll need DDR4 RAM, so you wont be able to use it with your old set.
Well that's one way to get around the bot.
Yes
I think that question will answer itself after you install the card.
No, you have to see them for yourself.
Integrated Graphics are built into most CPU's available today, so choose the best one with the best graphics.
There is no benefit to using USB 3.0 or 3.1 for those types of devices as they just use USB 2.0
That's not how it works.
Put in a push configuration (Ram side)
Just re-install the anti-virus after the reset.
I remember when GameStop first did this when steam gift cards first came out.
You can't OC a i3 6100 unless you have a motherboard and specific BIOS that supports it.
Show him the builds!
Initialize the disk and create a new partition.
Just less power consuming than the 390, otherwise they are pretty much identical performance wise.
The PS3 and 360 barely ran GTA V at playable framerates and it looked pretty bad to boot.
Just go to bed.
Upgrade the GPU, not for the performance boost but more to keep your room from turning into a sauna.
Is the monitor plugged into the motherboard instead of the GPU?
Probably just lower texture quality for games that actually take advantage of 4+ GB of VRAM
I'm not saying that Howie is a bad LF, it's just a play that only Puig would be able to make.
Pics?
Cooling efficiency would be impacted because of gaps in the parts.
Those are PCIe 1x slots
You'll probably only get 144Hz if you are using a Displayport cable.
Run it in administrator mode
Yep it's pretty bad
i3-6100
Guess you got the Anniversary update, which is pretty much the equivalent of installing a new OS.
Mid-high end.
It didn't have proper mouse support for the menus for the first week it was released.
They are currently 1st gen products, and that usually means they are pretty expensive.
Nope.
No, religious fundamentalists don't have a pile of evidence.
Two breasts and a mouth.
Except we see her come to the rebuilt town, which is empty, because as you said the narrative isn't fully completed yet.
It definitely looked like a picture frame the last time it was in the front page.
That line says he knew ABOUT Arnold, gives no context for ever having met him.
And it's not even on Eminem's album.
Because Ford covered it all up, and managed to secure funding through the MiB, for reasons yet unseen.
I tune into wheel for the last 5 minutes just in case my wheel number shows up
Sounds like a fabulous way to burn your genitals while watching top quality entertainment.
Great, now I have get all my antibiotics from chicken.

Nuke it from ~~orbit~~ your VPS provider's console and start again.
The fact that it is still working

Scott talked to Shelby too today
I mean.. it's always best to keep your meat shield around
If whit is the nom, they'll probably have some stupid people who split votes between each sister.. that should help us a lot
Probably 95%
Do you think Justin really would use it on Whitney?
I think Shelby confirmed she has the highest IQ in the house yesterday
"Last night she was crying, she kept saying ""I'm Sorry Alex"" and she told Shelby today that she was happy Julie asked Shelby about Alex bc she wouldn't have been able to even speak.. probably a number of things, but I'd say that's definitely the main reason"
It would explain the flower pin she always wears in her hair...
This gives me so much hope
100%
He replies later saying it wasn't
He's said he won't try though bc he thinks it could fuck up his CP (I believe)
She thinks she's a master manipulator and can't believe they didn't buy her bullshit
3 times, 4 if you include the fork
Thank god he did though
Lol
Unless Justin won and pulled down Kryssie
It's so sad that I couldn't tell that automatically bc he says things like this all the time
Somebody said they were on Monday... just not today
That much blood loss would traumatize anyone.
2nd most votes...?
Let's pray this rings true tonight
I am.
Morgan* Shelby has lawyer shit to do!
This is a joke
What makes you think Shelby isn't there anymore?
That would be my second guess.. only bc she hasn't shown up around here as much since Danielle left and especially not since Jason lost
This is a great question.
Rob was pro Jason during his interviews with Alex and Scott as well
#MAKE THE DARK ARTS GREAT AGAIN
This is so wrong but I laughed so hard
You mean *back in the good ole days* I think that's how Trump refers to it
Apparently he told the feeders while alone that if he wins HOH he is putting up Alex and Scott and would call them out on trying to make an alliance with him.
How do you not include her crying in the corner?
Alex would be, she's number 1 on their shit list
Better than them assuming America will take care of it like the misfits
He's wearing it.
Hopefully she stays the course
Justin or Jason could easily win that one.. it's one of the best CPs in my opinion and they have a lot of fans that have been waiting for good ones
It would be Marcellus dumb.
And complained to Justin about it.
Bc Danielle mentioned her son.. thanks a lot Danielle

Waking up every two hours to eat and randomly throwing half of it back up in bed from time to time.

Stay with SS with a month or two then maybe pick up say 531 with a bunch of accessory work and maybe get some sleeves

He can't know where he sucks until he has technical breakdown part of his issue with the press isn't technique its that one arm is different than the other.

I agree, but I hope this doesn't become a thing where we need to hear about a player's political stance before each game, because sports are supposed to be a way to relax and forget about the real world.
This is the type of logic needed here
Gailey can't make Fitz throw it nice, or make Marshall catch
If the Jets beat the Bills, the Ryans are going to get a little too much heat
I really wanna know what he thinks on Devin Hester going to the HoF
No, he clearly didn't, and if you think that's acceptable, well agree to disagree
"Is it a ""choose your own adventure""?"
Ronald McDonald doesn't need to know about this shit
He's a major league asshole, but god damn if his roles in Glengarry Glen Ross &amp; 30 Rock aren't among the best performances in film &amp; TV
"This is exactly like on Wayne's World when Wayne's ex warns him if he's not careful, he's going to lose her, with Wayne replying ""I lost you 10 months ago, get the net"""
Trump got her on it
Unless you're a liberal, AND she's unwilling
Honestly, while he should have Googled, the other guy was still a dick
The chance we don't win is 19.08%
He will come home, but he just hit his teenage years and is rebelling.

"It was from him that I learned ""72 virgins"" was a mistranslation of an Aramaic word (pedo muhammed wrote the book with both languages) meaning ""white grapes""."
He has suffered quite a few hits to the head to be fair.
Oooo I member
Better claim it fast before they do.
I've heard that one before.
I sincerely believe Chris Petersen could be as good as Urban Meyer or Nick Saban if he wanted to coach at a team like OSU or Alabama.
He was still pretty garbage in higher elos unless you had like 10000000 games on him.
"Cast of ""Hamilton""."
No need to feel like a dick - it was an experience that made me especially appreciate still being around for this baseball season, even before the whole playoffs thing.
The world is a far better place when Cutch plays like the Cutch we all know and love.
Fire Hudgens!
Astros fans would personally fly to New York and burn down Yankee Stadium once they run Luhnow out of town on a rail.
Yeah, it'd be ironic if it popped up in the middle of an article fixating on Bartman (which was kinda what I was hoping for after reading OP's title).

He vociferously doesn't like some LGBT folks and thinks they'll try to hurt his daughters (or uses that as a convenient excuse).

I'm impressed that it took 3 letters before one of them got around to mentioning us.
Sonuvabitch, college football is dumb (this year - yes, I'm just mad my team lost), I needed more postseason baseball to help make my Saturday better.
He's already stated multiple times that he would prefer to remain a fan from afar.
Hillary does not play easy.
Yes.
I unfollow him every time the model dips.
They capitulated immediately.
Silver lining: Clinton can bring up all the stuff the media is ignoring at the debates and Trump may not expect it.
The media loooooves smearing her in headlines even in stories that are good for her.
Well, your father dying is a pretty big deal...
I thought he supported Trump?
Hmm, Bayh may not win after all...
They've actually been going up for 3 days.
LOL, apparently Cheney wrote an op-ed blaming Obama for making the world less safe and it's trending on Twitter.
I'm pretty sure he said something like this before.
Gold?
I hope he doesn't concern troll too much.
Wait, where did he say he saw an actual poll?
Ugh, 538 adjusted the Upshot Florida poll to Trump+1.
Yeah, 538 is incorporating a lot of crappy 50 state polls and online tracking polls.
It's unusual to the media whenever she ties to woo anyone besides the poor oppressed white working class.
At least it's not as bad as between the conventions, when Trump reached 50.1% chance on polls only and 55.4% on now cast.
That's not true, 538 uses national polls to draw trend lines.
Yay!
Deplorable
Eh, if they didn't ask about the deplorables in the 1st debate, I doubt it, especially not in the VP debate since Hillary won't be the one having to explain herself.
Yay, Dems are ahead in all 3 races!
How much of that is for the 17 propositions?
Ohio is now blue on PEC!
Did they poll the Senate races?

It could just be differential nonresponse though.

When did nationalism ever go wrong in the past..
What happened to making them pay if they ship jobs out?
I don't think he knew and I doubt he had a position on it one way or the other.

Exit polls showed that Dems made up 38, R's 32, and I's 29% of the vote in the 2012 election, just for some fun data to look at.

Nah Rubio is definitely going to take the state, especially since there was just a disaster where he was out there and getting positive press.

The tree of liberty... (seriously, though, if you read the full quote from Jefferson, he says that people will be dumb and wrong and have dumb uprisings for dumb reasons and they will get crushed, but its nice to see they still have that fighting spirit, and its an overall good for the country that people still do).
Bush, for his many flaws, wasn't a racist and talked about inclusion.
Why do you think it would be remotely possible that LA would try to fire him over this?
I guess you just know the market better than all the phone manufacturers, eh?

Or an Ayatollah Assahola shirt.
Because you realized it was only 5:30, so hit the bar for some happy hour drinks and brain bleach?
And that's a capital offense.
The people of LA didn't buy into anything - they didn't pay to get the Rams back; the owner is paying everything for the new stadium.

David Duke was pretty well known to people who pay attention to politics before this election season.
This is what 20+ years of Fox News has wrought.
There is a surprising number of people that are happy with the current system and worry that any change will be for the worse, and would rather have the 'wink and a nod' provisions that proper rules.

Also, supposedly she has tattoo sleeves (but always wears wrist length stuff).

i'm thinking it was part of the bottom of the roster rotating and the intention would be to resign him (like bersin) since we don't have much on pass rush and, sadly, he's the number 2 sacks leader on the team.

Well Greens, y'all keep picking her, so she kinda *does* speak for you and she kinda *is* your leader.
All those precious tweets dragging him warm the cockles of my cold little heart.
This statement makes his caterwauling about Democrats not knowing how to talk to the white working class all the more disingenuous.
Yes, the articles about their behavior in NV and when they would create gauntlets to harass Clinton supporters as they entered rally venues in CA *really* had them frothing at the mouth.
It is a scary thing when so many people think that holding rallies is some grand achievement.
That is quite possibly the dumbest shit I have ever heard coming from them, and that is saying something.
I almost shed a tear of joy when he got eliminated the first time around and then Tim had to get all emotional and save his unworthy ass.

Yeah if these were HDMI cables I would probably end up with enough to be swimming in them.

Oh the irony in that statement could fill a ocean.
Wouldn't put it past em given how lackluster those sales usually are.
About the same as the standard 950 but with a better cooler, the 75W versions are likely binned better so they stay within the power limits.
Yes the streamers still get paid for the subs, that alone makes it worth it imo.
Moozey Agrees!
I guess sliding it into the HDD cage first then installing it into the PCI slot wasn't a idea?
Oh in that case probably not :( There is the $5 code though so you could see if you can get that back at least and put it towards a future order.
I tried looking for some more 950's but they got all bought up and are back to ~$110 in the warehouse :(
But muh circlejerk!
Those sales happen more often(like $20 off $100 in Automotive or some shit) but the real good ones are the site-wide coupons that give you like $10/20 off $50/100.
Because reddit.

Oh Bartz...I fused my 8 Bartz the other day, I regret nothing.
I can see myself getting two Orlandu, one per each troll rainbow I got this banner... I'm not greedy!
It's a classic Final Fantasy game (Equipment and battle system included) with a gacha system, it isn't just BF with a skin.
Doesn't that makes sense to you...?
Fuck off and let me be an asshole.
Thank god for emulators and GBA ports of Final Fantasy games, those were my entry into the series.
I would take Firion over my second Bartz any day of the week, I don't care if Firion isn't top tier, I want to get all the main FF protagonists...And like you said, he's a very good character to use with TMs like barrage or DW
Now you know :D
I think those people never played FF13 and that's why they destroy her name, it kills me inside every time I see something like that.
Russell is mine!
I literally broke my old Xperia phone because of the Royal Giant, I hated him so much, arena 8 was pure cancer
"""Lightning users hate him!!"""
INT has the best drop rate, it's all about RNG, don't worry.
I wasted half a Penelo on that run...
That's true, by that time I might even have a 5* base character
The only thing I know about stop is that enemies can't use their turns while stopped.
"I belive throw is only needed to use ""throw weapons"" like shurikens and stuff."
Blade Mastery+Masamune or GTFO!
I'm mad because I got Rosa and I can't get Cecil
I'm sure a lot of people completely ignored tanks like Leo or Charlotte and now they are stuck on ADV Col because of that (Thank god Cecil is a 3*) The only way I was able to defeat Brachiosaur was with Charlotte, that's when she became a permanent part of my team.
If you want to play for a long time it might be worth it, I don't know if I will get up to level 25, but 10 or 15 is a good number for me.
Because of her hat, it looks like the VLC logo
Most of the time you need to max out a character before understanding why they are so strong, most of the OP abilities come at level 80 (Barrage, Curaja, full break, etc)
Having your PC turned on all night is not really free if you think about it...
Bring a friendly Edgar, chaining is the future!
I know, but I have a 4k karma, they can't stop me from posting!

My point is, Wade had done a lot more for the Heat franchise than Lebron
Idk, I remember there being talk amongst some owners about not wanting to trade with the Warriors, even if they could've used Bogut
"""Maybe bring on some shooting guards that play in LA"""
Kobe is better than Lebron I know I'm wrong, but I don't care
He explained it pretty well, I meant that I wish I could recognize things like that while watching the game, ya know?
I think the Braun 1v3, the cruiserweights, the New Day and SheaSaro, and Jericho, Rollins, and Kevin were all good.
If you look at the game threads, most people were upvoted to the top saying Curry was the best in the world.

I doubt it would be aimed at you, though: You're probably much happier with a full sports package Whereas I basically only turn my TV on to watch F1 and would be fine with $20/mo: I guess I'm the target audience here, I think, rather than you: because I'm not splitting my TV budget between F1 and other sports/entertainment
"I laughed at this one, if I'm honest Mostly a ""Please don't let there be a nuclear holocaust"" kind of nervous giggle, but still..."
"Exactly, which is why I question the fact we use units sold in this article, but it was considered ""irrelevant"" in the 9to5 article about the iPhone 7 where they basically said ""Who cares how many units they sold"" - I'm discussing the inconsistency And the other part of my answer is unrelated to the units sold thing, it's discussing the fact we're comparing 1 MacBook Pro model to several hundred Windows laptop models that are sold, grouped and marketed in a different (and therefore not comparable) way"
I say plenty of dumb shit at work, too.
"It's a legal requirement for WG to not use it officially in game in many European countries, so to make it easier they just don't put it in game at all - besides legality, it's also just politically ""safer"" Many of us recognize it's part of history, though, rather than a political statement, and like using the realistic ones"
A combination of - Impressive use of the brake pedal (both application, and releasing it at the perfect time) - an F1-driver's understanding of the grip of the car - his own seemingly even better-than-a-standard-F1 driver's understanding of the grip of the car - A massive chunk of luck Releasing the brake momentarily at the right moment made an absolutely huge difference
Senna: Patron saint of racing
I think it would still have been pretty exciting - if nothing else, a single touch of a white line could've meant a DNF for Nico, and in the wet anything can happen
Yeah I'm generally against the DD-proofing of BB's: this BB meta is already pretty dull, if it expands it'd be pretty shitty for anyone who doesn't want to sit in a BB and slug it out.
I can't think of any with cruisers: although it's possible that the actual useful damage drops with the first CA of any line, after the best CL (eg Roon, Pensacola, Mogami 8 inch guns variant), although I feel like that's just a change in how the damage is delivered: I can't say any of those 3 ships feel weak
The Perth is the one time it's probably worthwhile, though - sitting in your own smoke for 90 seconds means the spotter plane adds some basic spotting at least nearby, and her range is crap without it: especially since she spends half the match crawling around at 1/4 throttle
Yeah there are certainly others; Not the best phrasing on my part, I just meant it as an example
"The Aoba is ""solidly ok"", definitely not a bad ship: but at T6 a CL is usually preferable over a CA IMO, so you may as well use the Cleveland instead and be more flexible without being any less effective"
Fantastic
haha yes, perfectly summed up If it's much over 10k you're mostly firing out of duty and to draw attention away from your cruiser buddies, not because you're actually expecting to hit anything Then about every 8 matches you hit 3 citadels when doing it and chuckle to yourself as you charge down a Colorado
Yeah, and we have to remember that we're seeing the immediate, tired, emotional-ridden reactions right after a near-2-hour race.
You got an additional reserve slot
Expect it to improve dramatically once you get out of the first few missions: the missions get harder, so will take longer to complete
Isn't it always?
The same campaign ran in various locations with the local dealership name
Sure, there are certainly people who find them fun: but I can't get excited about it when I'm assuming, at this stage, that WG will dick around with them.
Wallet warriors don't like the proletariat laughing at them

"ELI5: When her co-workers draw pictures and ask her what she thinks, she thinks it's good that they automatically include her without thinking ""Eww, girls have cooties"""
LinkedIn isn't really a thing - it's literally just an online resume for most Hardly the same as posting pictures of your dinner on instagram to make your friends jealous
Yet we still have people saying they think this is a positive thing
Sure, I'm just making the distinction that it's a cruiser with big guns rather than a battleship with less armour, which would be more akin to a battle cruiser
"Yeah, I think the ""Businessman with a silly bluetooth earpiece in"" stereotype has taken far too strong a grip to be dislodged by ""stylish guy with AirPods"""
I suspect there's also an element of people not understanding quite how much you're concentrating, when it looks relatively effortless
Yes
Nah, not for a simple parody reference

Move to the UK, we can cross the road whenever and wherever we like The **real** land of the free
Not when charging Not if I forget the adapter Not if I'm somewhere I didn't think I needed the adapter but now do Not if my one included adapter breaks and I can't use any of my 10 sets of headphones... etc I didn't say it completely ruins the point of a phone, I'm just saying it will be a huge inconvenience, and we're all basically being asked to pay $800 for less convenience... I pay money for tech to improve my life, not add headaches

The entire time watching, I was just hoping that this movie was really just 4 hours long.
There's lots of things like that which could be that supports that theory or it's a way to keep people from guessing.
Yeah, and he's been killing it.
The hell was the need to make it into 'episodes'?

While FNAF2 might be the worst FNAF game in the gameplay department, Its teasers and trailer were the best of the entire series.
This needs to make it to the front page.
It wouldn't even need you trapped in a suit for it to be able kill you.
"And by ""readers"" you mean me."
~~Because NomNomNomNation is going through his angsty phase~~
Lots of weird shit happens on Black Friday, that's why Bonnie looks traumatized.

If Scott ever makes another horror game, It should be about uncanny humanoid figures chasing us around(not necessarily animatronics), that would really creep me out.
Should it be named r/fakeassfnafads?

While I liked this accomplishment, I am still not sure if FNAF:TSE deserved it.
That's what I call a high quality shitpost.
Bonnie is distracted by something.
Good thing Scott decided to keep it like that.
~~Where's Automod when we actually need it?~~
Praise be.
Andrew Luck.
Agreed.
Lol this is gold.
I see more of a front office role for him instead.
Definitely the one offensive player I'd be thrilled with if we pick him in the first.
Yeah if Evans couldn't make it on the Seahawks roster as an o-lineman, I don't want him.
We could use someone to Rush the passer.

Kind of obvious but the NBA app is good for that
The older generations who say that millennials are sensitive are the same ones who cry about not being able to teach creationism in school and Kaepernick kneeling.
There's been offended people in every generation, millennials are no different.

Obligatory Trump debate response.

Obviously our weak womanly brains have been so thoroughly degraded by our exposure to feminism that we're now unable to comprehend this knowledge he seeks to bestow upon us.

"Easy Bake ovens aren't really a ""thing"" here in NZ, which is a damn shame because they seem fucking awesome."
An example of what?
In my country (NZ) most people wear both together.
